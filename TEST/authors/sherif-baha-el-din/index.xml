Conserving Egypt’s reptiles under climate change&lt;br&gt;
Journal of Arid Environments, 127:211–221&lt;br&gt;
10.1016/j.jaridenv.2015.12.007&lt;br&gt;
Climate change has caused range shifts and extinctions of many species in the recent past. In this study, the effects of climate change on Egyptian reptiles were investigated for the first time using species distribution models. Maxent was used to
model the current and future distributions of suitable habitats for 75 terrestrial reptile species from Egypt. The modelled distribution for current suitable conditions for each species was projected into the future at three time slices using two
emission scenarios from four global circulation models and under two assumptions of dispersal ability. Climate change is expected to vary in its effects spatially, with some areas characterized by increased species richness while others show
declines. Future range changes vary among species and different future projections, from the entire loss to large gains in range. Two species were expected to become extinct in at least one future projection, and eight species were expected to
lose &amp;gt;80% of their current distribution. Although Protected Areas have greater conservation value, on average, compared to unprotected areas, they appear inadequate to conserve Egyptian reptiles under expected climate change. &lt;br&gt;
Over the last century, relatively rapid changes of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate have been recorded with warmer temperatures accompanied by altered geographical and seasonal distributions of precipitation (Araújo and Rahbek, 2006; Thuiller, 2007). There is
widespread agreement that climate change will have a large impact on the survival of populations, species and communities (Suarez and Tsutsui, 2004), and that biodiversity is continually being transformed in response to it (Hannah et al., 2005).
Over the last 40 years climate change has been implicated as the main cause for distributional shifts and extinctions (Thomas et al., 2004), with a particularly strong impact on butterflies, birds and species at high altitude (Hannah, 2011).
Although the recorded effects of climate change on biodiversity seem in general to materialize rather slowly, its effects are expected to become increasingly prominent over the next 50 years and beyond (Thuiller, 2007). Some climate change model
forecasts suggest that 15–37% of current species will be committed to extinction by 2050 (even without taking into consideration the biological factors of competition and evolutionary history) (Thuiller, 2007), making it essential to involve
measures for mitigating its potential impacts in future conservation plans. &lt;br&gt;
Detailed information on the ecological and geographical distributions of species is essential for conservation planning and forecasting (Elith et al., 2006) especially where species face multiple conservation problems. Species Distribution Models
(SDMs) quantify the relationship between species&amp;rsquo; occurrence and environmental variables and allow users to extrapolate this relationship to new areas or time periods. SDMs have been widely used to estimate the potential impacts of climate change
on species distributions and ecosystems (Franklin, 2009) and estimate potential future extinction risks. Once a model has been calibrated for current climate conditions, it can be used to estimate potential distributions at different time periods
(in the future or the past) by using information on expected climates, or to different study areas in order to assess the potential locations where invasions are more likely to establish (Franklin, 2009). This helps to manage species facing
possible future threats by identifying biological corridors for dispersal, determining sites for re-introduction and areas require more protection measures (Thuiller, 2007). &lt;br&gt;
Climate change will potentially affect the biodiversity and species composition of Egyptian ecosystems (Tolba and Saab, 2009), but only a handful of quantitative studies of the local fauna/flora have been conducted using SDMs. This may be because
the models are relatively new and because until very recently reliable comprehensive biodiversity records for the Egyptian fauna and flora were not available. As a developing country, Egypt lacks a recording scheme to collate species sightings
(either at national or even at local Protected Area level). Between 2004 and 2008, all available biodiversity records were collated by the BioMAP project (see: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biomapegypt.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.biomapegypt.org/&lt;/a&gt;), and studies of butterflies and mammals using SDMs became
possible (Gilbert and Zalat, 2008; Basuony et al., 2010; Newbold, 2009; Newbold et al., 2009a,b). A few other SDM studies have been published: El Alqamy et al. (2010), to estimate the potential distribution of the Nubian Ibex (Capra nubiana) in
South Sinai; Soultan (2011), to test the potential impact of climate change on the distribution of four Egyptian antelope species; and Leach et al. (2013), who assessed the effect of climate change on the future effectiveness of the Protected Area
network, using data on Egyptian butterflies and mammals. The only other study of the effects of climate change in Egypt, by Hoyle and James (2005) on the world&amp;rsquo;s smallest butterfly, the Sinai Baton Blue (Pseudophilotes sinaicus), used an
occupancy-based Population Viability Analysis. &lt;br&gt;
The global current Protected Areas seem not to overlap well with areas of high biodiversity value, and are traditionally determined spatially and environmentally under the assumption of relatively low changes in species distribution in the future
(Araújo, 2009; Leach et al., 2013). As climate change is expected to affect the future distribution/range of many species globally (potentially moving some species out from Protected Areas; Hannah et al. 2007), it challenges the future
effectiveness of current Protected Areas. Future conservation investments should be effectively prioritized due to the limited resources available (Wilson et al., 2009; especially in the developing countries), and early actions may be more
effective and less costly than delayed or no actions (Hannah et al. 2007). Conservation prioritization can be at taxonomic (for the protection of some rare or endangered species) or spatial (conserving a particular habitat type or species rich
areas, e.g. potential Protected Areas) scale. Spatial conservation prioritization uses spatial quantitative data to identify areas of high conservation priority (Wilson et al., 2009), and some techniques have been available recently; e.g. Zonation
(Moilanen et al., 2012) and Marxan (Ball et al., 2009). Some of those techniques can use spatial outputs from SDMs to prioritize areas for conservation under current and future climates. &lt;br&gt;
To date, there are 30 Protected Areas in Egypt covering &amp;gt;15% of its total area. Their distribution shows good spatial coverage, although some areas of high diversity importance (especially at the Nile Valley and Delta) are not yet protected
(Newbold et al., 2009a). They were declared relatively recently (first in 1983) and were determined mainly based on experts&amp;rsquo; known knowledge of the country biodiversity (Newbold et al., 2009a). The capacity of current Protected Areas in Egypt to
mitigate for potential impacts of climate change on different species groups is not well-investigated yet and a qualitative assessment of their future effectiveness is highly required. Also, spatial prioritization of the Egypt&amp;rsquo;s landscape (inside
and outside the Protected Areas) is required to identify potential locations for future Protected Areas and identify current Protected Areas need more conservation effort in the future. &lt;br&gt;
As a developing country, Egypt lacks enough good-quality data to be used directly for spatial conservation prioritization, but SDMs can provide valuable estimates for species suitabilities in the space. In this study, we use data for the Egyptian
reptiles, for the first time, to run SDMs (as a representation group for the Egyptian fauna). Baha El Din (2001, 2006) presented a geographic interpretation of Egypt&amp;rsquo;s herpetofaunal distribution, qualitatively identifying priority conservation
areas, but very little has been published on how the Egyptian herpetofauna may respond to climate change. We used Maxent to model the distribution of Egyptian reptiles under current climate conditions, then models are projected into the future to
show how collectively and individual species are expected to respond to future climate change under different assumptions. For each species, future expected range change (% loss or gain of currently suitable habitats) is estimated, aiming to shed
light on some species require more strict conservation actions. Expected reptiles&amp;rsquo; species richness (under current and future climates) is estimated to identify areas of current high reptile suitability and areas expected to undergo much changes
in suitability in the future. Model predictions were used for prioritizing the Egyptian landscape under current and future climates. We used Zonation software (Moilanen et al., 2012) to assess the likely effectiveness of Egypt&amp;rsquo;s Protected Area
network under current and future climate. Outputs from Zonation represent hierarchic ranking of the landscape for conservation and can be easily visualized as maps. We hope the results of the current study to be useful for biodiversity
conservation in Egypt and (along with the results of relative studies) to be taken into account by the decision makers in future national conservation plans. &lt;br&gt;
Study area and presence records &lt;br&gt;
According to Baha El Din (2006), Egypt has at least 109 species of reptiles: 61 lizards, 39 snakes, a crocodile, seven turtles and a tortoise, and Acanthodactylus aegyptius has been added as a distinct species since (Baha El Din, 2007). The main
source of species location records was the BioMAP (www.biomapegypt.org) database of Egyptian biodiversity records; with our own records, the data are comprehensive for the herpetofauna. Records for marine or aquatic species from the Nile were
excluded because of the lack of GIS predictor layers for aquatic environments. &lt;br&gt;
The taxonomic and georeferencing accuracy of these records were exhaustively checked, assessed and revised. We limited our scope to species with at least eight unique pixels (at a resolution of 2.5 arc minutes) to avoid over-fitting (Baldwin,
2009): this meant that a total of 75 species were processed (49 lizards, 25 snakes, and a tortoise: Table S1). The coverage of the records is good (Fig. S1a); they include most of Egypt&amp;rsquo;s landscape and habitats. There was an inevitable bias in
recording effort (represented by the number of valid records) towards the main cities and populated areas (Fig. S1b): unsurprisingly, the highest collection effort was found around the greater Cairo district, followed by South Sinai (the St
Katherine area), the Alexandria area, some areas around Fayoum and Wadi El-Natrun and small patches near El-Arish and Mersa Matruh. (Figs. S2–S3 show a map of Egypt overlaid with geographical locations of areas mentioned in this study and the
locations of currently established Protected Areas, respectively). &lt;br&gt;
Environmental predictor variables &lt;br&gt;
Climate data for the near past (1950–2000) were downloaded from WorldClim Global Climate Data v1.4 (release 3 – see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldclim.org/bioclim&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.worldclim.org/bioclim&lt;/a&gt;) (Hijmans et al., 2005). These data represent current climate conditions and comprise 19
‘bioclimatic’ variables derived from precipitation and temperature records (Table 1). Four (Bio-7, -14, -17 &amp;amp; -18) were rejected a priori as not sufficiently variable across Egypt, reflecting the country&amp;rsquo;s status as the driest country in the world
(FAO, 2012). A resolution of 2.5 arc-minutes (∼5 × 5 km) best matched the level of positional uncertainty that accompanies the records (most of which derive from museum records georeferenced by site name), and because the climate data for Egypt
were interpolated using relatively few weather stations largely concentrated in the Nile Valley and Delta (see Fig. 2.3 in Newbold, 2009). This relatively coarse resolution is also useful to minimise the effect of ignoring species interactions on
modelled distributions (Pearson and Dawson, 2003). &lt;br&gt;

Elevation data were obtained from the SRTM Digital Elevation Database v4.1 [available at: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cgiar-csi.org/data/elevation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.cgiar-csi.org/data/elevation&lt;/a&gt;]. The tiles that cover Egypt were downloaded at 90-m resolution and rescaled to 2.5 arc minutes. We also used an
Egyptian habitat map from the BioMAP project (A. A. Hassan, unpublished data). In this map, the habitat of Egypt is classified into 11 classes (sea, littoral coastal land, cultivated land, sand dune, wadi, metamorphic rock, igneous rock, gravels,
serir sand sheets, sabkhas and sedimentary rocks – see: Newbold et al., 2009a). Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data for seven years (from Jan 2004 to Dec 2010) were downloaded from the SPOT Vegetation website (see:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://free.vgt.vito.be/)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://free.vgt.vito.be/)&lt;/a&gt;. Two layers were derived from these maps and used as predictors in the models: maximum NDVI value (indicating how much vegetation there is per pixel), and the difference between maximum and minimum NDVI value (indicating
variability in vegetation per pixel). &lt;br&gt;
To reduce colinearity among predictors and over-fitting, the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was calculated for the continuous predictors using R v2.15.0 (R Development Core Team, 2012) and used to prune predictors before use (e.g. Bombi et al.,
2012) until all remaining variables yielded VIF values below 10 (Table 1): these were then used in the Maxent modelling. &lt;br&gt;
Climate models used &lt;br&gt;
To estimate the potential impact of climate change, current distribution models were projected into the future for three time slices (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, each the median of a 30-year window). Future climate data (IPCC, 2007: downloaded from
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ccafs-climate.org/)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.ccafs-climate.org/)&lt;/a&gt; derived from four independent Global Circulation Models (GCMs) were used to obtain consensus estimations about the fate of the herpetofauna. These GCMs were the Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 (HadCM3), the
Canadian second-generation coupled global climate model (CGCM2-CCCma), the Australian model (CSIRO Mk2) and a Japanese model (NIES99), all frequently used in similar studies (e.g. Araújo et al., 2006; Holt et al., 2009). Our results assume that
species try to track their suitable habitat (dependent on dispersal ability) rather than accommodate or adapt to the new conditions. &lt;br&gt;
For each GCM model and time slice, two emission scenarios (A2a and B2a) were used, the most commonly used scenarios in climate-change assessments (Hannah, 2011). They reflect two different assumptions about the levels of CO2 emissions, linked to
assumed demographic changes and socio-economic and technological developments (Marini et al., 2009). The A2a scenario assumes a lot of climate change caused by medium to high CO2 emission rates (the “business as usual” scenario), while the B2a
scenario assumes relatively little change because of mitigation measures (the “moderate” scenario) (Sauer et al., 2011; Taubmann et al., 2011). There are no data on how NDVI and habitat variables might change in Egypt in the future, and so we
assume they (and altitude) remain constant. Apart from the A2a scenario for 2080, nearly all the expected climatic conditions are similar to current values (see Fig. S4).&lt;br&gt;
Species distribution modelling &lt;br&gt;
We used Maxent v3.3.3k (Phillips et al., 2006 – see: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.princeton.edu/∼schapire/maxent/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.cs.princeton.edu/∼schapire/maxent/&lt;/a&gt;) to run the species distribution models. Maxent performs well in comparison with alternative algorithms and shows equal or higher predictive
accuracy on cross-validation (Elith et al., 2006; Hernandez et al., 2006). Crucial to our decision not to use ensemble modelling, Maxent is very robust to small numbers of training records, outperforms other algorithms when using a relatively
small number of occurrence records (Franklin, 2009), and is robust against moderate location errors (Graham et al., 2008). We used ‘permutation importance’ (see Phillips and AT&amp;amp;T Research, 2011) to detect which predictor had the greatest influence
on the model because it does not depend on the path used by the algorithm (Songer et al., 2012). &lt;br&gt;
Ten replicated runs with cross-validation and default settings (except iterations = 1000) were made for each species, by iteratively partitioning the records to use 90% for training and 10% for testing (as recommended by Phillips and AT&amp;amp;T
Research, 2011); this gives a more stable model performance (avoiding overfitting) and minimises the effects of errors and biases. The default logistic output format was chosen, i.e. related to probability of suitable conditions, ranging from 0 to
1. Logistic output has been criticized recently (e.g. Merow et al., 2013) because many users assume that it represents the probability of occurrence; to do that, however, the calculation must assume that overall prevalence is fixed at 0.5 for all
species, which may not be accurate: estimating true prevalence is very difficult (Elith et al., 2011). Both logistic and raw outputs are monotonically related and rank locations identically (Elith et al., 2011), making rank-based measures such as
AUC (for model evaluation: Elith et al., 2011) and thresholding (using values from predictions of the training presence locations, e.g. 10th-percentile threshold) identical whichever is used. We used logistic output for two main reasons: a) it
standardises the expected habitat suitability values across species, permitting the adding together of species to create the ‘probability richness’ maps; b) it allows Maxent automatically to convert the probabilities into expected presence/absence
(or, more precisely, suitable/non-suitable) habitat. For the latter we used the 10th-percentile training presence threshold (following Pearson et al., 2007). For each species (and for each of the logistic and thresholded distributions), the ten
replicate distribution maps were converted to a single consensus map, by Maxent for logistic values, and manually for thresholded values (where each pixel was a consensus presence if it had presence values in more than half of the model runs, i.e.
&amp;gt;5). &lt;br&gt;
Distributions were then projected into three future time slices (2020, 2050, and 2080), in each of four GCM models (HadCM3, CCCma, CSIRO, and NIES99) and two emission scenarios (A2a and B2a), giving a total of 24 future projections. Thresholded
future distributions involved two extreme assumptions about dispersal ability: unlimited and no dispersal. For each of the 24 projections, three consensus maps were produced; one using the probability (logistic) output, and two using the
thresholded distributions (assuming unlimited and no-dispersal). The maps were then averaged across the different GCMs; for thresholded distributions, this involved assigning a pixel as potentially suitable if it had a value of presence in more
than two GCMs. Thus there were 18 (three time slices, two scenarios, three consensus) maps per species. &lt;br&gt;
2.5. Comparisons across species &lt;br&gt;
Current and future maps of estimated species richness were calculated in two different ways: first, by simply adding together the average probability of suitable conditions for each pixel across the distribution maps of all species (this assumes
unlimited dispersal; e.g. Gilbert and Zalat, 2008); and second, by adding together the thresholded distribution maps (under unlimited- and no-dispersal assumptions; e.g. Trotta-Moreu and Lobo, 2010). Maps of future species richness were obtained
for each of the 24 future projections and then averaged across the four GCMs. Future potential changes in species richness (but not composition) were calculated by subtracting current species richness at each pixel. &lt;br&gt;
At the species level, gains and losses in future distribution were calculated using current and future consensus thresholded distributions. Then the losses across all the 24 future potential distributions across all species were added together
into a species loss map, showing which areas are expected to suffer most in losing species (for each dispersal assumption). The same was carried out for gains in suitability to produce a species gain map, showing which areas are expected to gain
species (only for the unlimited dispersal assumption). Species turnover, an index of dissimilarity between current and future species composition (Thuiller, 2004) was calculated for each future projection and dispersal assumption (following
Thuiller et al., 2005). &lt;br&gt;
In order to assess future extinction risk and to determine which species may require more protection in the future, species range changes were calculated as the percentage loss (or gain) in suitable habitats, carried out for each dispersal
assumption. Each species was classified into one of the following categories: Extinct (expected loss of the entire suitable habitat - 100%), Critically Endangered (loss &amp;gt;80%), Endangered (loss 50–80%), Vulnerable (loss 30–50%), Least Concern (loss
30%), gain 1 (gain 30%), gain 2 (gain 30–50%), gain 3 (gain 50–80%), gain 4 (gain 80–100%), and gain 5 (gain &amp;gt;100) (modified from Thuiller et al., 2005) (see Tables S2–S3). &lt;br&gt;
Area prioritization for conservation &lt;br&gt;
Several algorithms are now available to prioritize areas for conservation and conservation planning. Using the SDM predictions, Zonation v3.1 (Moilanen et al., 2012) created a nested spatial conservation prioritization network to evaluate the
effectiveness and performance of current Protected Area network in Egypt and identify new sites for conservation. Zonation prioritizes the conservation value of the landscape hierarchically based on the conservation value of sites (cells)
(Moilanen et al., 2012), by iteratively removing the least valuable cells from the edges of the landscape according to set rules. The last to be removed are the most important areas (Moilanen et al., 2012). We used two removal rules: ‘basic
core-area function’, to identify important (or poor) locations where a single or a few species have important occurrences; and ‘additive benefit function’, to give more weight to locations with high species richness (Moilanen et al., 2012).
Fragmentation of the chosen areas is minimized by an aggregation rule, and we chose to use ‘distribution smoothing’, for which an estimate of dispersal distance is required. The dispersal ability of almost all terrestrial reptile species is very
limited (Cadby et al., 2010; Edgar et al., 2010). To be conservative, in this study the dispersal distance of all reptiles was set to be equal to 1 km. &lt;br&gt;
Because some species are more important to conserve than others, each species was given a weight. Weights were developed from the global and national IUCN assessments, the world distribution, and distribution patterns within Egypt. Following
Gilbert and Zalat (2008) and Basuony et al. (2010), we classified Egyptian reptiles according to their world distribution and their distribution pattern within Egypt. We assessed their IUCN Red List status in Egypt according to IUCN guideline and
categories (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee, 2010), although inevitably incomplete. We gave each element a score (modified from Leach et al., 2013) to indicate relative importance, and then the sum of the scores gave the relative
conservation weight of each species (see Tables S1 and S4). We used these values to weight the Zonation prioritization process. &lt;br&gt;
For current and future climates, Zonation was run using the maps of habitat suitabilities for all species. The number of cells removed at each iteration was set to 10 (=‘warp factor’). Zonation produces ASCII raster files with ranked pixel values
scaled to be from 0 to 1: values &amp;gt; 0.7 were considered to be of high conservation importance. These important areas were then overlaid with the current Protected Area network in Egypt to show if the network in Egypt is adequate to conserve the
species in the face of climate change, and if there are areas outside the current Protected Areas boundaries that require special protection measures. &lt;br&gt;
Model performance &amp;amp; variable importance &lt;br&gt;
In terms of mean AUC values for the 10 cross-validation runs, the performance of current-distribution models was good (see Table S1), ranging from 0.78 to 0.99 with an overall mean of 0.93 ± 0.05. Only one species (Ptyodactylus siphonorhina) had a
mean AUC of less than 0.8, while in 36 species it was greater than 0.95. As almost all species had a mean AUC &amp;gt;0.8, all models were accepted and processed for further analyses. More widespread species tended to have lower AUC values (correlations
[n = 75] with: number of suitable pixels, rs = −0.85, p 0.005; extent of occurrence, rs = −0.77, p 0.005; number of pixels with records, rs = −0.433, p 0.005). &lt;br&gt;
Variables with highest mean permutation importance across all modelled species were altitude (highest for 34 species), Bio4 (temperature seasonality, 10 species), and Bio13 (precipitation of wettest month, 9 species). Those with the lowest mean
permutation importance, and thus not influencing the final models very much, were the difference between maximum and minimum NDVI, Bio15 (precipitation seasonality), habitat and Bio9 (mean temperature of driest quarter); the first and last of
these were never the most influential variable for any species. &lt;br&gt;
Species richness &lt;br&gt;
The patterns of current species richness (Fig 1) were similar using either logistic or thresholded distributions, both emphasizing the lower Nile Valley, the Suez Canal area, and the coasts of the Mediterranean and Suez Gulf (Fig. S2 for locations
map). The pattern is concordant with the species richness map in Baha El Din (2006), produced using records and qualitative criteria (see Fig. S5a). Under climate change, regardless of emission scenario or dispersal assumptions, several areas are
expected to have increased species richness (Fig. 2), with generally greater magnitudes under the A2a scenario, while others are expected to decline (e.g. the Suez Canal area), with greater declines under the B2a scenario by 2050 and 2080. &lt;br&gt;

(shown in Fig. 1a), and is averaged across four GCM models. Maps made (a) using Maxent logistic output; and (b) using thresholded distributions (see Methods). &lt;br&gt;
Areas with the highest expected loss of species include between greater Cairo, Ismailia and Suez, south of Suez on both sides of the Suez Gulf, and Wadi El-Natrun, much greater under the B2a scenario (Fig. 3a). If species can disperse well, then
the highest gains in species are expected to include a large proportion of the northern half of the Western Desert, again greater under the B2a scenario (Fig. 3b). In terms of percentage change of the reptile assemblage, if dispersal is unlimited
then the Western Desert is expected to undergo high turnover (Fig. S6a), but this is because there are so few species there currently. Under no dispersal, turnover is very limited (Fig. S6b), again with highest values again in the Western desert
because of the species poor assemblages there. &lt;br&gt;

GCM models, accumulated across species, and then plotted. &lt;br&gt;
Range and status changes &lt;br&gt;
With unlimited dispersal, no species is expected to become “extinct” (100% loss of suitable habitat) under all or the average of all GCMs. There are a couple of species expected to become extinct by losing their entire area of suitable habitat in
at least one of the future projections: Tarentola mindiae and Hemidactylus robustus. Using the average gain or loss of suitable habitat across the four different GCMs, eight species are expected to be classified as Critically Endangered (loss &amp;gt;
80%), twenty as Endangered (loss 50–80%), and twenty-two as Vulnerable (loss 30–50%) in at least one mean future projection (details, see Table S2). &lt;br&gt;
When assuming no dispersal at all, none of the species are expected to lose all suitable habitats under all or the average of all GCMs, but T. mindiae and H. robustus again experience complete loss of habitat under at least one of the projections.
Using the average loss of suitable habitat across the four different GCMs, ten species are expected to be classified as Critically Endangered, twenty-seven as Endangered, and thirty-three as Vulnerable in at least one mean future projection
(details, see Table S3). &lt;br&gt;
Area prioritization for conservation &lt;br&gt;
The areas with the highest current prioritization value for conservation were similar for both cell-removal methods, mainly emphasizing the north coast, Suez Canal area, South Sinai, the Gebel Elba region, Qattara Depression, Wadi El-Natrun, and
around Cairo &amp;amp; Fayoum, with the ‘additive benefit’ function putting greater emphasis on the Nile Delta and its fringing areas (Fig. 4). This overall pattern does not change much under future climate projections, though a few areas decline in
priority and much greater area of the northern Western Desert increases. These effects are more pronounced with the ‘core-area function’ used as the cell removal rule. &lt;br&gt;

Fig. 4. Current conservation prioritizationl of areas, according to the Zonation algorithm under two cell removal rules: (a) core-area function (identifies areas where one or more species have important occurrences); and (b) additive benefit
function (which gives greater emphasis to areas with high species richness). Darker colours represent higher conservation value. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of
this article.) &lt;br&gt;
The mean prioritization value in all models was higher in Protected Areas than outside them (Fig. 5), with both slightly increasing in future projections. The difference in prioritization value between inside and outside Protected Areas declined
with time, especially by 2050 and 2080 under the B2a scenario. &lt;br&gt;

The results of this study show for first time the potential impacts of climate change on the distribution of Egyptian reptiles. Some reptiles are expected to lose much of their currently suitability areas (up to 80% in some cases), and some areas
will lose or change a large proportion of their species. Thus there will be a need for greater conservation efforts in the future. Some of these areas are already inside Protected Areas and so hypothetically they are protected, while others are
either just outside or very far from Protected Areas. Although overall Protected Areas contain better (higher priority) values compared to unprotected sites, the current Protected-Area network appears inadequate for future conservation. Our
results together with others (e.g. Leach et al., 2013) will help the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency and other decision-making parties in Egypt to direct conservation efforts and limited conservation resources in the right direction. &lt;br&gt;
Model performance &amp;amp; variable importance &lt;br&gt;
The negative correlations found between AUC and the area occupied, and with the extent of occurrence, concur with findings of many other studies (e.g. Brotons et al., 2004; Elith et al., 2006; Hernandez et al., 2006). Rare species are usually
habitat specialists, with narrow environmental tolerances, and are environmentally or geographically restricted compared to widespread species (Elith et al., 2006; Pandit et al., 2009). Widespread species are likely to be generalists occupying a
wide range of habitats and climates, making it difficult to distinguish between suitable and unsuitable habitats (Franklin et al., 2009). However, as pointed out by Elith et al. (2006), this may be an artefact, an inevitable result for species
with small relative occurrence areas, and perhaps a reason not to use AUC to compare model performances (Lobo et al., 2008). Most (about 60%) of the Egyptian herpetofauna are narrowly distributed, occupying less than 10% of Egypt&amp;rsquo;s area (Baha El
Din, 2006). There is no evidence of a strong correlation between model accuracy and the number of records used (see Elith et al., 2006; Newbold et al., 2009b), and the weak negative correlation found here is unusual since most (e.g. Stockwell and
Peterson, 2002; Hernandez et al., 2006) find that models with larger sample sizes have higher accuracy (but see de Pous et al., 2011). &lt;br&gt;
We found altitude to be the most effective predictor for many species. In contrast, the NDVI predictors were not useful, unlike in many other cases (e.g. Egbert et al., 2002; Anderson et al., 2006; Kgosiesele, 2010; Taheri, 2010), but perhaps
typical for arid environments (e.g. Soultan&amp;rsquo;s (2011) study on Egyptian antelopes) or for herpetofauna (e.g. Teodoro et al., 2013). Habitat categories likewise made only a low contribution to the reptile models. &lt;br&gt;
Species richness &lt;br&gt;
Species richness by itself is not adequate as an indicator of biotic change, since species composition can change independently. Our results suggest that in the future some areas with currently high expected species richness may lose many species,
or undergo large changes in species composition. Some of these areas are already under a certain degree of protection, but even if they can be maintained or enhanced (e.g. Siwa oasis, Gebel Elba, and the coastal areas over the Aqaba gulf: Fig.
S2), current Protected Areas are not sufficient to prevent expected loss of species. Other areas (e.g. Wadi El-Natrun, the Suez Canal area, Red Sea inland wadis, the poorly known Qattara Depression, and the areas around Gebel El-Gallala and Gebel
El-Hallal) are unprotected and measures are needed to conserve them. There are similar situations elsewhere: for example, high species loss and turnover in the reptiles of a priority conservation hotspot in Europe (the Iberian Peninsula) are
expected (de Pous, 2011), with great variation in expected patterns of loss and change with different projections and dispersal assumptions. Other studies have also concluded that large changes are likely in chelonians worldwide (Ihlow et al.,
2012), Mediterranean mammals (Maiorano et al., 2011), US trees and vertebrates (Currie, 2001) and MesoAmerican trees (Golicher et al., 2012). &lt;br&gt;
Range and status changes &lt;br&gt;
Two species are expected to lose their suitable habitats entirely in at least one future projection: 1) T. mindiae is a near-endemic species recorded just from northwest Egypt and northern Cyrenaica (eastern Libya); its distribution in Egypt is
restricted to Siwa oasis, the Qattara Depression and their periphery (Baha El Din, 2006). Future range changes suggest it will be Endangered (loss 50–80%) by 2020 and as Critically Endangered (loss &amp;gt;80%) by 2050 and 2080 (under all emission
scenarios and dispersal assumptions). 2) H. robustus is localized to the East African coast from Zanzibar to southern Egypt, Arabia, east to Pakistan; its distribution in Egypt is on the Red Sea coast from El-Quseir southwards (Baha El Din, 2006).
The A2a scenario suggests it will be Critically Endangered by 2020 and 2050, while under the B2a scenario it will be Endangered by 2020 and Critically Endangered by 2050 and 2080. More than half of its current distribution in Egypt is located
within the Wadi El-Gemal and Gebel Elba Protected Areas, so hypothetically it is protected. However, it is found mainly on buildings and hence associated with man; it may in fact be an invasive to Egypt. &lt;br&gt;
Another eight species are expected to be classified as Critically Endangered (loss &amp;gt;80%) in at least one averaged future projection (Acanthodactylus longipes, Cerastes vipera, Eryx jaculus, Eumeces schneiderii, Malpolon moilensis, Ptyodactylus
guttatus, P. siphonorhina and Trapelus mutabilis). According to the current assessment, twenty-seven species are classified as Endangered (loss 50–80%) in at least one projection (mostly by 2080 in the A2 scenario); two of these are classified,
assuming no dispersal, as Endangered in all future projections (Uromastyx aegyptia and Pristurus flavipunctatus; for details see: Tables S2–S3). &lt;br&gt;
Reptiles are also likely to gain from global warming, especially in more northern areas of the globe, if they can disperse and expand their distributions, but under perhaps the more realistic assumption of no dispersal, most species were expected
to lose habitat suitability by 2050 (Araújo et al., 2006). In Egypt, areas of clear future expected gain (assuming unlimited dispersal) are the area between the Siwa oasis and Qattara Depression, northwards almost to the northern coastal strip,
and some sparse locations in central Sinai. There were greater gains under the B2a scenario, in the eastern part of the Western Desert and some patchy areas around the Nile (Fig. 3b). This pattern is similar to that reported by Araujo et al.
(2006). &lt;br&gt;
Some of the species identified here as being most at risk due to future climate change, are in fact resilient species that are ecologically very adaptable and are currently experiencing range expansion and population growth, at least in Egypt
(e.g. H. robustus). This disparity is probably because modelling is based solely on the probable impacts of climate change on the spatial distribution of suitable habitats, without taking evolution or ecological adaptability and resilience into
account. Species vary greatly in their response to ecological change, some adapting very well even to very rapid anthropogenically induced changes (e.g. invasive species), while others are much less adaptable and tend to go extinct first. &lt;br&gt;
There are no published studies that discuss the effect of climate change on Egyptian reptiles, obviating any comparisons. Information on the reptiles of the adjacent countries of Sudan and Libya are very limited, making it impossible to assess any
movements that might compensate for Egyptian losses. The patterns of expected changes in Leach et al.&amp;rsquo;s (2013) similar study on mammals and butterflies do not concur with ours. Mammal species richness was expected to decline in the Mediterranean
and Red Sea areas (by 40–60%) and increase elsewhere (by 80–100%); while for butterflies, declines are expected over almost the whole of Egypt (by 40–60%) except the south, which is expected to increase (by 40–60%). In the models of European
reptiles (de Pous, 2011), between eight (unlimited dispersal) and 21 (no dispersal) species were expected to become extinct in at least one future projection, with two more losing more than 80% of their currently suitable habitats. This is a much
more damaging scenario than the expected responses of Egyptian reptiles in our study. There are no other comparable studies from North Africa or the Middle East. &lt;br&gt;
Area prioritization for conservation &lt;br&gt;
In our study, Protected Areas (Fig. S3) were more valuable in conserving reptiles than areas outside them both currently and in the future, although the difference is expected to get smaller with time (Fig. 5). Although this is encouraging, the
Protected Area network appears inadequate to conserve Egyptian reptiles. New Protected Areas that have already been proposed would go some way towards reducing this deficiency in coverage, although others will be needed: in the middle to north
Sinai (especially around Gebel El-Hallal), the Suez Canal area, both sides of the Suez Gulf, the northern Mediterranean coast, coastal wadis of the Red Sea between Hurghada and Mersa Alam, and the Gebel El-Gallala area. More effective protection
is required in the established Protected Areas, including those in South Sinai, Gebel Elba, and Siwa oasis due to their relatively high expected future suitability loss. The Protected Areas of Siwa oasis and El-Gilf El-Kebir plus the areas of Wadi
El-Natrun, the Gebel El-Hallal area and wadis of the Red Sea are expected to have particularly high turnover in species composition (Fig. S6), and hence probably need more conservation efforts. Some comparable information is available for Egypt&amp;rsquo;s
butterflies and mammals (Gilbert and Zalat, 2008; Basuony et al., 2010; Leach et al., 2013). Egypt&amp;rsquo;s network of Protected Areas appears adequate to conserve Egyptian butterfly hotspots, except for the Mediterranean coast between Alexandria and
Sallum (Gilbert and Zalat, 2008), but inadequate to conserve important mammal areas, with new Protected Areas needed to be constructed in the lower Nile Valley, along the north coast between Alexandria and Sallum, top part of the Suez Gulf, and
perhaps the Qattara Depression (Basuony et al., 2010). Suggestions for conserving mammals are consistent to some extent with our results, which also suggest new Protected Areas along the Suez Gulf, Mediterranean coast from Mersa Matruh to Sallum,
and the Qattara Depression. Leach et al. (2013) concur with our results in suggesting priority areas along the western Mediterranean coast, around Greater Cairo, central and north Sinai, and the Red Sea coast. &lt;br&gt;
Limitations &lt;br&gt;
There are some limitations of the results shown in this study. 1) Egyptian climate data in WorldClim are interpolated from rather few non-randomly placed weather stations in Egypt and adjacent countries. Although making the climate data less
reliable than elsewhere, there are no alternative climate data available. 2) An ensemble approach (e.g. using BIOMOD; Thuiller et al., 2009) is often suggested for SDM modelling to avoid dependence on one particular algorithm. This is not possible
without a greater number of records, since other algorithms are not as flexible or robust as Maxent. Despite all the caveats with using SDMs, and criticisms of Maxent in particular (Royle et al., 2012; but see Hastie and Fithian, 2013; Elith et
al., 2006; Hernandez et al., 2006), in practice countries such as Egypt have little else to guide them in attempts at climate change adaptation. 3) There were signs of sampling bias in the available records. Although this violates the assumptions
of all SDMs, it is a problem common to nearly all datasets worldwide. New techniques may allow for the correction of sampling bias; e.g. using target-group approach (Phillips et al., 2009), although the data requirements are currently impossible
for Egypt and most other developing countries), 4) Using Maxent&amp;rsquo;s default settings is criticized by some authors: they need to be modified dependent on the data (Warren and Seifert, 2011; Radosavljevic and Anderson, 2014; Merow et al., 2013); but
we think using the default settings is enough in this study. &lt;br&gt;
Conclusion &lt;br&gt;
Although Egyptian datasets exist, knowledge of Egyptian species and conservation priorities are limited (with consequences explored in Leach et al., 2013); nevertheless our results and those of Leach et al. (2013) encourage us to believe that
useful insights can be gained for conservation priorities by using the combination of species distribution modelling plus spatial conservation prioritization techniques (Hannah, 2010; Klorvuttimontara et al., 2011). It is crucial for the Egyptian
Environmental Affairs Agency to establish an accurate and reliable database of records, assessed by experts, to help improve the basic information for future conservation assessments and analyses. &lt;br&gt;
Although many SDM studies have been done on a variety of organisms in recent decades aiming to solve conservation problems, evidence of their practical utility in real-world conservation is sparse, with very few studies clearly targeting
conservation decisions (Guisan et al., 2013). If implemented correctly, SDMs can play a critical role in supporting spatial conservation decision-making (Addison et al., 2013). For reptiles, there is a shortage of studies estimating their response
to expected climate changes (Araújo et al., 2006). Although some suggest that reptiles (and to a greater extent, amphibians) will be strongly affected by climate change (e.g. Gibbons et al., 2000; Araújo et al., 2006; Carvalho et al., 2010), very
few of them were concerned with arid environments or the Middle East. We hope that this and other similar studies that estimate the fate of reptiles under climate change help decision-making authorities to take the measures necessary to conserve
them.&lt;br&gt;

Hemidactylus flaviviridis: a very densely populated species and likely to be associated with man. &lt;br&gt;
Pristurus flavipunctatus: based on its narrow habitat, strict containment in natural habitats, low densities, and high vulnerability of habitat, it does fit the VU category. &lt;br&gt;
Tarentola mindiae: based on its current distribution, it has quite a large range but a rather narrow habitat. It may be reasonable to be classified at higher threat level (possibly Near Threatened “NT”). &lt;br&gt;
Trapelus savignii: expected to have higher threat level. &lt;br&gt;
Uromastyx ornata: suggested to have a lower threat level even though its range in Egypt is very small and its population size is smaller as well. &lt;br&gt;
Chamaeleo africanus: Could be of lower threat category due to its large range in Egypt (essentially the whole Nile Valley) and quite dense populations which are expanding rapidly. It also has a very large African range; even invaded parts of
Greece. &lt;br&gt;
Acanthodactylus pardalis: should have a greater threat level. It is practically extinct! &lt;br&gt;
Chalcides cf. humilis: more recent data indicate its very widespread distribution in Egypt, it occupies a range equal or greater than that of C. ocellatus. &lt;br&gt;
Eryx jaculus: should be classified at a higher threat status than E.colubrinus or at least equal to it. It is almost extinct from Egypt. &lt;br&gt;
Testudo kleinmanni: in reality it may be extinct. &lt;br&gt;

Testing the accuracy of species distribution models using species records from a new field survey&lt;br&gt;
Oikos, 119(8): 1326–1334&lt;br&gt;
10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.18295.x&lt;br&gt;
Species distribution models are a very popular tool in ecology and biogeography and have great potential to help direct conservation efforts. Models are traditionally tested by using half the original species records to build the model and half to
evaluate it. However, this can lead to overly optimistic estimates of model accuracy, particularly when there are systematic biases in the data. It is better to evaluate models using independent data. This study used independent species records
from a new to survey to provide a more rigorous evaluation of distribution-model accuracy. Distribution models were built for reptile, amphibian, butterfly and mammal species. The accuracy of these models was evaluated using the traditional
approach of partitioning the original species records into model-building and model-evaluating datasets, and using independent records collected during a new field survey of 21 previously unvisited sites in diverse habitat types. We tested whether
variation in distribution-model accuracy among species could be explained by species detectability, range size, number of records used to build the models, and body size. Estimates of accuracy derived using the new species records correlated
positively with estimates generated using the traditional data-partitioning approach, but were on average 22% lower. Model accuracy was negatively related to range size and number of records used to build the models, and positively related to the
body size of butterflies. There was no clear relationship between species detectability and model accuracy. The field data generally validated the species distribution models. However, there was considerable variation in model accuracy among
species, some of which could be explained by the characteristics of species. &lt;br&gt;
Species distribution models have great potential as tools for conservation. They relate a set of records of the occurrence of a species to a set of variables describing relevant aspects of the environment in order to predict its distribution over
the whole of the study area in question (reviewed by Wintle et al. 2005). &lt;br&gt;
There is a vast amount of data on the distributions of species in museums, natural history collections and the literature (Graham et al. 2004). However, there are several limitations associated with data from these sources. First, records are
often accompanied by an imprecise description of the locality from which they were taken. This translates into poor locational accuracy when the record is georeferenced (i.e. when it is assigned geographical coordinates, Graham et al. 2004). The
effect of locational error in the species records on the accuracy of distributional models is generally low, but varies among different types of model (Graham et al. 2008). &lt;br&gt;
Second, museum data are often biased. Such bias could be: 1) spatial – towards areas to which it is easy for scientists to gain access, or towards areas that are biologically interesting; 2) temporal – towards time periods when collecting was more
frequent; or 3) taxonomic – towards species that are easy to detect or that are of more interest to the collectors (Soberón 1999, Hijmans et al. 2000, Reddy and Dávalos 2003). &lt;br&gt;
The third major problem with data from museums and literature sources is that there are rarely data documenting places where the species is known not to exist (absence records) (Graham et al. 2004). There are modelling techniques designed to be
used with datasets that consist only of presence records, such as climate envelope approaches and techniques that model the presences with reference to the background environmental conditions (Wintle et al. 2005). However, several of the most
popular modelling approaches, such as generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs), can only be used with both presence and absence data. A commonly-used solution to this problem is to generate random ‘pseudo-absence’
data in grid cells without presence records (Ferrier and Watson 1997). One obvious problem with using pseudo–absence data is that some absences are likely to be found in areas that are suitable for, and even inhabited by, the species (Graham et
al. 2004). Of course, recorded absence of species may also prove to be erroneous. Many species are very difficult to detect and it may take many visits to a site before species absence can be inferred with any degree of confidence (Kéry 2002,
MacKenzie et al. 2002). Given accurate species records from a well-designed survey, models built with only presence records have been shown to perform as well as models built with both presences and absences (Wintle et al. 2005) and may present
the safest option when there is uncertainty over the reliability of absence data. &lt;br&gt;
Data from museums, collections and the literature are too valuable a source of data to ignore. However, given the potential biases and inaccuracies associated with them, it is particularly important to test the accuracy of model predictions. The
simplest way to test the accuracy of a species distribution model is to test its ability to predict correctly the data used to build it in the first place (Fielding and Bell 1997). This is effectively a measure of goodness-of-fit of the model. The
main drawback of this approach is that a model can fit the data used to build it very well without capturing the species’ real response to the environmental variables (a phenomenon known as overfitting), and this method of model evaluation tends
to lead to over-optimistic measures of model accuracy (Chatfield 1995). A better approach is to partition the data in some way, building the model with part of the dataset and evaluating it against the remainder (Fielding and Bell 1997). This is
the approach taken by most studies (Hernandez et al. 2008, Franklin et al. 2009). A problem with data-partitioning approaches is that if the same bias in the species data is present in all partitions, then the model may be biased and the estimate
of model accuracy inflated (Chatfield 1995). Ideally models should be evaluated using new, independent data on species occurrence (Chatfield 1995). With the wide availability of global positioning systems (GPS), records can be assigned
geographical coordinates on collection, eliminating the problem of locational errors. Bias should be reduced as much as possible, particularly bias in environmental space (Wintle et al. 2005). Few studies have used independent data to validate
models because collecting such data can be impractical, time-consuming and costly (Wintle et al. 2005, but see Loyn et al. 2001, Elith 2002, Ferrier et al. 2002, Elith et al. 2006, Williams et al. 2009). To the best of our knowledge only one
study, on Mexican birds (Feria and Peterson 2002), has used new, independent records to test the accuracy of distribution models based on museum data. Given the potential limitations with records from museums, it is particularly important that the
accuracy of models based on them are evaluated rigorously. We used independent records to test the accuracy of distribution models for a variety of species in three separate taxonomic groups. &lt;br&gt;
Even if one is confident of a lack of bias in the data, different kinds of species may be more or less suited to the model-building process. There have been attempts to assess differences among species in the accuracy of their distribution models
(Kadmon et al. 2003, Berg et al. 2004, Seoane et al. 2005, Hernandez et al. 2006, Newbold et al. 2009b). These studies have often found that species that are more narrowly distributed produce more accurate distribution models, possibly because
small-ranged species have better-defined habitat requirements and tend to inhabit a greater proportion of the suitable environment, or because in species with larger ranges, populations show local adaptation to the environment in different areas
(Stockwell and Peterson 2002, Brotons et al. 2004, Segurado and Araújo 2004, Hernandez et al. 2006, Newbold et al. 2009b). On the other hand, effects of range size could be a statistical artefact associated with the use of pseudo-absence data
(Lobo et al. 2008). &lt;br&gt;
Species that are easier to detect are likely to have more complete occurrence data. This may result in more accurate distribution models for these species (Seoane et al. 2005). For example, Pöyry et al. (2008) showed that the accuracy of
distribution models for butterflies was positively related to wingspan, possibly owing to differences in detectability during surveys. &lt;br&gt;
In this study, we modelled the distributions of Egyptian butterfly, mammal, reptile and amphibian species using records from museums, collections and the literature, presenting a rare test of their accuracy using new, independently-collected
survey data as well as a test using the more traditional data-partitioning method. It was not possible to collect new species records systematically or randomly in the time available because of the remoteness and inaccessibility of many parts of
Egypt, but the records were completely independent of the data used to build the models, were designed to be representative of as many habitat types as possible, given the constraints imposed by the logistics of sampling in a remote and hostile
environment, and were georeferenced using a GPS and so had negligible locational error. We used the new survey data, which contain both presence and absence records, to test whether a negative effect of species range size on model accuracy
persists in the absence of statistical artefacts. We also tested whether model accuracy is related to species detectability and body size (of butterflies). &lt;br&gt;
Data and methods &lt;br&gt;
Distribution models were compiled for Egyptian butterfly, mammal, reptile and amphibian species using Maxent ver. 3.1.0 (Phillips et al. 2006). Maxent uses a machine-learning process to produce a model where the frequency distribution of modelled
probabilities is as close to uniform as possible, with the constraint that the expected value of each environmental variable (the sum, across all grid cells, of the product of the probability of occurrence and the value of the environmental
variable) must equal the mean value at the presence points (the empirical average). To prevent overfitting a process called regularization is adopted, relaxing this constraint such that the expected value of each environmental variable may fall
within a defined margin around the empirical average (Dudík et al. 2004). Maxent is particularly suited to use with museum data, because it designed to deal with datasets consisting only of presence records. The environmental conditions in a
sample of cells from throughout the whole study area is used for comparison with the environmental conditions in cells with species presence records in. &lt;br&gt;
The species data used to build the models (hereafter referred to as the original species records) were taken from the database complied as part of Egypt&#39;s BioMAP project ( www.biomapegypt.org for more details). Records were taken from museum and
personal collections, and from the literature (Osborn and Helmy 1980, Larsen 1990). The identification of all extant specimens was checked by experts (Samy Zalat, Sherif Baha-El-Din, Francis Gilbert, Dr Mohammad Basuony, Al Azhar Univ., Cairo),
according to the latest taxonomic opinion (Larsen 1990, Wilson and Reeder 2005, Baha El Din 2006). All records were mapped as accurately as possible using a gazetteer developed by the BioMAP project. We estimated the maximum error associated with
each sampling location using the point radius method (Wieczorek et al. 2004) and removed records from highly inaccurate localities. Given positive spatial autocorrelation in the environmental variables, a moderate degree of inaccuracy in the
location of species records probably does not have a large effect on model accuracy (Graham et al. 2008). The number of records available for each species ranged from 10 to 412 (median = 58); most records were made in the second half of the 20th
century (Newbold et al. 2009a). &lt;br&gt;
The environmental variables used in the models consisted of climate and habitat variables. The climate variables were taken from the WorldClim ver. 1.4 dataset (Hijmans et al. 2005). This dataset includes 20 variables describing altitude,
temperature and precipitation (Supplementary material Appendix 1). The habitat variable used was a geological habitat classification with 11 categories (sea, littoral coastal land, cultivated land, sand dune, wadi, metamorphic rock, igneous rock,
gravel, serir sand sheet, sabkha and sedimentary rock). This map was compiled using satellite imagery, and was verified by extensive ground-truthing (A. Hassan unpubl.). Using 20 environmental variables might cause the models to be overfitted
(Chatfield 1995). However, the Maxent model uses a process called regularization to reduce the chance of overfitting and previous studies have shown that it can produce accurate models with small numbers of species records and similar numbers of
environmental variables to our study (Wisz et al. 2008). To test whether this was the case in our study, we built a separate set of distribution models using habitat and three principal component axes based on the climatic variables. Models
developed using the two sets of variables were very similar (at 5000 random points in Egypt modelled probabilities of occurrence correlated positively – Spearman&#39;s rank correlation: mean rs= 0.798 ± 0.02) and were not significantly different in
accuracy (Wilcoxon&#39;s matched-pairs test: p = 0.122). &lt;br&gt;
To create a second set of species data (hereafter referred to as the independent species records) with which to evaluate the distribution models, we conducted a survey of butterflies, mammals, reptiles and amphibians in Egypt in the summers
(May–July) of 2007 and 2008. The reptile, amphibian and mammal species surveyed are active throughout the summer months. The flight periods of all of the butterfly species surveyed encompassed the whole period of sampling. The new records were not
used to build distribution models, only to evaluate them. The new data were biased towards roads. The terrain in Egypt makes it almost impossible to sample completely randomly, with many areas situated hundreds of kilometres from the nearest road.
We minimized bias in environmental space as much as possible by selecting sites that covered: (1) as large a geographical area as possible; and (2) as many different habitat types as possible, defined using a geological habitat map (A. Hassan
unpubl.) and a vegetation land cover map, derived using data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (Hansen et al. 2000). At each site we performed four 1-km walking transects at different times of day (early morning, late morning, late
afternoon, evening), paced to take approximately an hour and a half each. At the same time, some members of the expedition actively searched for species in the area surrounding the start point of the transect. Transects were located such that they
sampled all the major habitat types present at each site. A species was recorded as being present if it was observed at least once, and absent otherwise. Twenty-one sites were surveyed in this way (Fig. 1, Supplementary material Appendix 1). In
addition to records from the fully-surveyed sites, we also included incidental observations of species from 13 other localities (Fig. 1, Supplementary material Appendix 1). Data from these sites consisted of records of species presence only,
because we did not carry out replicate transects at these sites and thus could not infer species absence. Almost all new sites were situated at least 1 km from sites with records in the original dataset (Fig. 1). All fully-surveyed sites were at
least three km from the nearest other site, and all but four were at least ten km from the nearest other site. Including locations with incidental records, distances among sites were sometimes much smaller; four sites were less than one km from
the nearest other site and 15 sites were less than ten km from the nearest site. Butterflies were sampled by visual searching and sweep netting, reptiles and amphibians by visual scans and active searches, and mammals mainly by checking for tracks
and signs, although sightings of species were also noted. Sixty species were recorded in total, 34 of which were recorded at least twice: 20 reptiles and amphibians, ten butterflies and four mammals (Supplementary material Appendix 1). &lt;br&gt;
Sites with reptile, amphibian, butterfly and mammal records in the BioMAP database (grey crosses and asterisks), and sites that were sampled during the new survey (black triangles). &lt;br&gt;
Imperfect detectability of species is likely to have an impact on the reliability of data describing species absence from surveys such as ours (Kéry 2002, MacKenzie et al. 2002). We modelled the detectability of species in our new survey data,
following MacKenzie et al. (2002). The four transects undertaken at each site were treated as independent visits (n1, n2, n3, and n4). The likelihood (L) of obtaining a particular pattern of occurrence for a species across all four transects at
all fully-surveyed sites is: &lt;br&gt;
where ψ is the probability that a species occurs at a given site, p is the probability that the species is detected during one transect given that it occurs at the site, t is the transect number, n. is the number of sites where the species was
recorded in at least one transect, and N is the total number of sites visited (MacKenzie et al. 2002). The parameters p and ψ were estimated using a maximum likelihood approach with the package ‘mle’ in R (R Development Core Team 2004). Upper and
lower bounds of 0.0001 and 0.9999 respectively were set for both parameters. The model has been shown to be reasonably robust to sample sizes as small as those encountered here (Wintle et al. 2004). The model assumes that occurrence and detection
probabilities are constant across sites, which is almost certainly not true. The modelled probabilities should therefore be considered rough estimates to gauge the reliability of the occurrence data and not as accurate estimates of the
probabilities of detection and occurrence. &lt;br&gt;
The distribution models were evaluated using three different sets of data. First, using partitioned data, whereby the original species records were divided randomly before modelling – half for model building and half for model evaluation. Models
were evaluated using these reserved presence records and 2500 pseudo-absences (Ferrier and Watson 1997), drawn randomly from cells that lacked a record of the species in question. Second, using the independent species presence records and 2500
pseudo-absences, generated as before. Third, using the independent presence and absence records. Model accuracy was measured using the AUC statistic (Fielding and Bell 1997). The receiver operating characteristic curve is a plot of the proportion
of presence records correctly predicted present (sensitivity) against the proportion of absence records incorrectly predicted present (commission) for a range of thresholds used to divide predicted presence from predicted absence. The area under
the curve (AUC) measures the ability of the model to discriminate recorded presences from recorded absences (Fielding and Bell 1997). An AUC value of 1 indicates perfect discrimination and an AUC value of 0.5 indicates a model that is no better
than random. Estimated accuracy according to AUC values was compared among the three approaches. We correlated estimates of accuracy made by partitioning the original species records with estimates made using the independent records, to test
whether models were ranked similarly. To provide an alternative measure of accuracy to the AUC statistic, the models were also tested against the independent presence and absence records using the slope of the relationship between model predicted
probability and species occurrence (presence or absence), fitted using a generalized linear model with binomial errors (McCullagh and Nelder 1989). &lt;br&gt;
We tested a number of factors that may explain variation in model accuracy (measured using the independent presence and absence records) among species: (1) estimated species detectability (2) range size in Egypt; (3) number of presence records
used to build the models; and (4) taxonomic group (mammals, butterflies, or reptiles and amphibians). The proportion of Egypt&#39;s land area predicted by the distribution models to be occupied was used as an index of range size. To calculate this, we
converted the continuous prediction of probability of occurrence into a binary prediction of presence or absence, by assigning a threshold probability of occurrence to the model for each species. The threshold was set such that 95% of the presence
records used to build the models were predicted correctly as being present (Pearson et al. 2004). &lt;br&gt;
The effect of estimated species detectability on distribution-model accuracy was tested by a simple correlation test, because detectability could not be estimated for species that were not recorded during the walking transects. As an additional
test of the effect of estimated species detectability, we also correlated butterfly wingspans (wing-tip to wing-tip; Gilbert and Zalat 2007) with model accuracy. The remaining factors were tested using generalized linear models with normal errors.
AUC values were entered as the dependent variable, taxonomic group as a factor, and predicted range size and number of presence records used to build the model as covariates. We used a model selection method based on the approach recommended by
Burnham and Anderson (2002). We built a global model with all terms, and candidate models with every combination of terms. AIC scores were extracted for each model and the difference between a model&#39;s AIC value and the lowest value of all models
(the AIC difference, Δi) was calculated. Model weight was calculated using the following formula (Burnham and Anderson 2002):&lt;br&gt;
where Δi is the AIC difference of the model in question and Δrs are the AIC differences of the other models. The relative importance of each variable was assessed by summing the AIC weights of all candidate models containing it (Burnham and
Anderson 2002), hereafter referred to as ‘sum of AIC weights’. &lt;br&gt;
Results &lt;br&gt;
Estimates of the probability of detecting a species in a single transect (p) ranged from less than 0.001 to approximately 0.75 (Table 1). For butterflies, the migratory species Vanessa atalanta and Vanessa cardui, and the skipper Pelopidas thrax
had low probabilities of detection, but most species were relatively easily detected. Mammals generally had much lower probabilities of detection than butterflies; the gazelle Gazella dorcas was an exception because its presence could be reliably
ascertained by tracks and faeces. Reptiles and amphibians were highly variable in their estimated detectability. The snakes and the chamaeleon Chamaeleo africanus had very low probabilities of detection, while the lizards, skinks and amphibians
generally had higher probabilities. Estimates of the probability of site occupancy (ψ), which is equivalent to the proportion of sites predicted to be occupied, were consistent with estimates of range size derived from the species distribution
models (Spearman&#39;s rank correlation test: rs= 0.453, n = 23, p = 0.03). &lt;br&gt;

Model accuracy estimates made by partitioning the original species records into model-building and model-evaluation datasets, were high and significantly better than random (one sample t-test: t = 22.0, DF = 33, p 0.001). AUC values ranged from
0.666 to 0.975, with an average of 0.845 ± 0.016. Accuracy estimates made using the independent presence records (i.e. records from the new survey) and pseudo-absences were also high and significantly better than random (t = 16.7, DF = 33, p
0.001). AUC values ranged from 0.485 to 1.000, with an average of 0.875 ± 0.022. Finally, accuracy estimates generated using the independent presences and absences were reasonably high and significantly better than random (t = 4.03, DF= 33, p
0.001), although lower than estimates made using pseudo-absences. AUC values ranged from 0.219 to 1.000, with an average of 0.655 ± 0.039 (for examples of the distribution models, Fig. 2). Testing the accuracy of models against the independent
records, using the slope of the relationship between model predicted probability of occurrence and observed occurrence (presence or absence), also showed the predictions to be reasonably accurate. The relationships were positive for 26/34 species,
although only nine were significantly positive (GLM: p 0.05). Slope coefficients ranged from –5.67 to 22.13; the average coefficient was significantly greater than zero (one sample t-test: t = 3.16, DF = 32, p = 0.003). Estimates of accuracy made
using subsets of the original presence records correlated significantly and positively with estimates made using the independent records (Spearman&#39;s rank correlation: rs= 0.544, n = 34, p = 0.001; Fig. 3). &lt;br&gt;
Predicted distributions and independent occurrence records for two species: (a) the Montpellier snake Malpolon monspessulanus, which had the most accurate distribution model; and (b) the cape hare Lepus capensis, which had the least accurate
distribution model. Distribution models were built with Maxent ver. 3.1.0 using records from the BioMAP database and variables describing climate and habitat. Light shading indicates areas with a high probability of occurrence, while dark shading
indicates a low probability of occurrence. The independent occurrence records (+= presence; O = absence) were collected during a new field survey of 21 sites in the summers (May–July) of 2007 and 2008; these records were used to evaluate the
distribution models. &lt;br&gt;
The relationship, for 34 species of Egyptian mammal, butterfly, reptile and amphibian species, between distribution-model accuracy estimated using independent species presence and absence records, and distribution-model accuracy estimated using
partitioned data, whereby the original species presence records were randomly divided in half for model building and model evaluation respectively. Accuracy was estimated using the AUC statistic (Fielding and Bell 1997). &lt;br&gt;
Model accuracy showed no clear relationship with estimated species detectability (Spearman&#39;s rank correlation: rs=–0.294, n = 25, p = 0.154). However, for butterfly species, wingspan correlated positively with model accuracy (Pearson s correlation
coefficient: r = 0.652 n = 10, p = 0.041; Fig. 4). Model accuracy was negatively related to the predicted range size of species within Egypt (GLM: sum of AIC weights = 0.952; Table 2, Fig. 5a). Surprisingly, there was also a strong negative effect
of the number of species presence records used to build the models on the accuracy of predictions (sum of AIC weights = 0.991; Table 2, Fig. 5b). There was little support for an effect of taxonomic group on the accuracy of distribution models (sum
of AIC weights = 0.172; Table 2). &lt;br&gt;
Table 2. Results from a set of generalized linear models with a normal error distribution testing factors affecting variation in the accuracy of species distribution models among species. Factors tested were predicted range size in Egypt (R),
number of presence records used to build the models (S), and taxonomic group (T). Candidate models were built with every combination of terms. These models were compared using AIC and the difference between the AIC of a model and the minimum AIC
of all models. Model weights were calculated following Burnham and Anderson (2002). &lt;br&gt;
For 34 species of Egyptian reptiles, amphibians, butter-flies and mammals: (a) the relationship between range size, estimated as the proportion of grid cells in Egypt predicted occupied, and the accuracy of distribution models estimated using
independent species records from a new field survey; (b) the relationship between the number of presence records used to build the distribution model and model accuracy, estimated using independent species records. Model accuracy was measured
using the AUC statistic (Fielding and Bell 1997). &lt;br&gt;
Discussion &lt;br&gt;
Overall, the distribution models built in this study were shown to be significantly better than random when tested against independent data collected by surveying a diverse range of habitats in Egypt. This strongly suggests that data from museums,
natural history collections and literature can be used to make useful predictions about species’ ranges. Several studies have reached a similar conclusion (Peterson et al. 2002, Raxworthy et al. 2003), but it is rare that models are tested against
independent evaluation data (but see Loyn et al. 2001, Elith 2002, Ferrier et al. 2002, Elith et al. 2006). Uncertainties and biases will be more prevalent in models built using museum and literature records (Graham et al. 2004), making evaluation
with independent data more important. Some authors have experimented with using species records from separate geographical areas (Peterson and Shaw 2003, Randin et al. 2006, Heikkinen et al. 2007) or time periods (Raxworthy et al. 2003) to
evaluate models. However, predictions extrapolated outside the environmental conditions encompassed by the data that were used to build the model are likely to be inaccurate in the new areas even if they are accurate in the area for which they
were built. The best approach is to collect new, independent data inside the study area for which the models were developed reducing bias as much as possible, particularly bias in environmental space (Wintle et al. 2005). &lt;br&gt;
The reliability of data on species absence probably depends on the relative detectability of the taxa in question (MacKenzie et al. 2002). There was substantial variation in estimated detection probability among species in the new survey. The
results of the maximum likelihood model were consistent with our expectations. First, the predicted proportion of sites occupied correlated positively with predicted range size according to the distribution models. Second, detection probabilities
were very low for elusive species, such as the snakes, and for rare migrants, such as the red admiral butterfly Vanessa atalanta, and higher for conspicuous and more abundant species, including some of the lizards and most of the butterflies. The
accuracy of species distribution models did not appear to be affected by detection probability suggesting that, even in small-scale surveys with relatively few visits to each site, imperfect detection of species may not be a major problem. On the
other hand, the accuracy of distribution models for butterfly species was positively correlated with body size, which was used as a surrogate for detectability. It is possible that our maximum likelihood-based estimates of detection probability
were inaccurate; for instance, one of the major assumptions of the maximum likelihood model that we used is that occurrence and detection probabilities are constant across sites (MacKenzie et al. 2002), which is very unlikely to be true. However,
very abundant and easily detectable species, such as the long-tailed blue butterfly Lampides boeticus and Bosk&#39;s lizard Acanthodactylus boskianus, had high estimated detection probabilities and inaccurate distribution models, whereas species that
are difficult to detect, such as Montpellier&#39;s snake Malpolon monspessulanus, had low estimated detectability but very accurate distribution models. An alternative explanation for the relationship between butterfly wingspan and distribution-model
accuracy is that larger butterflies are more mobile and able to reach a greater proportion of suitable habitat, giving a closer correlation between environmental variables and occurrence (Pöyry et al. 2008), although the effect of body size on
butterfly mobility is contentious (Cowley et al. 2001). &lt;br&gt;
Estimates of model accuracy made using the data partitioning approach were relatively consistent with estimates made using the new survey data. This suggests that a data-partitioning approach can give us a good idea about the relative accuracy of
models and can be used to compare model accuracy among species. Accuracy estimates made using the partitioned species records and pseudo-absences, and also with independent presence records and pseudo-absences, were much higher than estimates made
using both independent presence and independent absence records. This is consistent with a previous suggestion that overly-optimistic estimates of model accuracy can be generated using pseudo-absence data (Lobo et al. 2008), but it should be borne
in mind that the small numbers of independent records may partly explain the low measures of accuracy using independent data. Nevertheless, further comparisons of model accuracy using pseudo-absences and real absences are needed and it would be
prudent not to use data partitioning as the sole method for evaluating distribution models, especially if the models will be used for conservation decision-making. The accepted threshold of 0.7 above which models are considered to be good (Pearce
and Ferrier 2000) may place undeserved confidence in poor predictions. &lt;br&gt;
Some of the variation in model accuracy was explained by range size. Species with larger ranges within Egypt were modelled less accurately than species with smaller ranges. A negative effect of range size on the accuracy of species distribution
models has been reported before (Stockwell and Peterson 2002, Brotons et al. 2004, Segurado and Araújo 2004, Hernandez et al. 2006, Newbold et al. 2009b), but most of these studies have used real presence data with pseudo-absence data. Thus, the
apparent effect of range size could be a statistical artefact owing to pseudo-absences being more distant in environmental space from the presence records for species with smaller range sizes (Lobo et al. 2008). Our results show that the
distributions of species with smaller ranges are modelled more accurately even in the absence of statistical artefacts. This could be because narrowly-distributed species have more specific climate and habitat requirements than more widespread
species (Brotons et al. 2004, Hernandez et al. 2006). Alternatively, separate populations of widespread species may show local adaptation to the environmental conditions in different parts of the study area (Stockwell and Peterson 2002, Brotons et
al. 2004): although two of the butterfly species have more than one sub-species in Egypt (Carcharodus stauderi and Spialia doris; Gilbert and Zalat 2007), these distinctions were not considered in this study. &lt;br&gt;
Surprisingly, we found a significant negative effect of the number of species records used to build models on the accuracy of model predictions. Most previous studies have found the relationship between sample size and model accuracy, if present,
to be positive (Pearce and Ferrier 2000, Phillips et al. 2004). Several studies have shown that species with narrower distributions and more specific habitat requirements are modelled more accurately (Kadmon et al. 2003, Hernandez et al. 2006,
Newbold et al. 2009b). It is probable that some aspect of this was captured by sample size but not by the measure of range size that we used. For example, more narrowly distributed species are likely to be less abundant (Gaston et al. 2000) and
thus detected less often during surveys. Alternatively, habitat specialists may be easier to model because they have very specific requirements, but may be restricted to particular microhabitats or resources and thus have been detected less
frequently in the past. &lt;br&gt;
Ideally data used to evaluate the accuracy of distribution models should be completely independent of the data used to build the models and free from any bias (Chatfield 1995), but given limited resources this may not be possible (Wintle et al.
2005). Although our new species records contained some bias (for example, towards locations near roads), we reduced environmental bias by selecting sites that covered as broad a range of climate and habitat types as possible. This approach is
better than simple data-partitioning, because some bias has been eliminated and because locational error in the records has been eliminated. Moreover, it is more practicable than a truly random survey, especially for less accessible areas such as
Egypt. The time constraints imposed on our field expedition meant that we were only able to survey the northeast part of Egypt. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the models were accurate for other parts of Egypt, particularly in the Western
desert where museum records are scarce. Nevertheless, at least in northeast Egypt, the models appeared to provide an accurate reflection of the distribution of species. &lt;br&gt;
In conclusion, our results support the use of species distribution models in ecology. Predictions made for many species in three very different taxonomic groups were shown to be accurate using completely independent species occurrence data.
However, there was considerable variation across species in the accuracy of distribution models. Distribution models have great potential as tools for conservation, but it is crucial that their predictions are first evaluated thoroughly.
Currently, using completely independent data to evaluate model predictions is a rare practice, which is not surprising given that conducting new surveys can be time-consuming and very expensive (Wintle et al. 2005). However, we show that even
small field surveys can be used to test model accuracy and can highlight patterns in the accuracy of models. &lt;br&gt;
