Abstract 
 
Climate change  has  caused range shifts  and  extinctions  of  many  species  in 
the past. In this study, the effects of climate change on Egyptian reptiles, as a 
representative of the Egyptian fauna, was investigated for the first time using 
species distribution models, relatively new tools now used in a variety of fields 
from  conservation  planning  to  the  assessment  of  species’  responses  to 
climate  change.  In  this  study,  the  Maxent  algorithm  was  used  to  model  the 
current and future distributions of 75 terrestrial reptile species from Egypt. The 
modelled distribution for current conditions for each species was projected into 
the  future  for  three  time  slices  (2020,  2050  and  2080)  using  two  emission 
scenarios (A2a and B2a) from four global circulation models (CCCma, CSIRO, 
HadCM3  and  NIES99)  and  under  two  assumptions  of  dispersal  ability 
(unlimited dispersal and no dispersal). This produced a total of 48 projections 
for  each  species.  Current  and  future  species  richness  patterns  were 
determined from  the results using the average response  across the different 
global  circulation  models  to  represent  a  consensus  view.  For  each  species, 
possible  changes  in  range  were  calculated  and used  to  assess  future  threat 
status. A national Red Data listing for the Egyptian reptiles was determined to 
show  which species require  more conservation  measures. Zonation software 
was  used  for  conservation  prioritization  to  show  which  areas  require  more 
protection under current  and future climates,  and to  assess the  effectiveness 
of Egypt’s Protected Areas network to conserve reptiles. 
Climate change  is  predicted  to  vary  in  its  effects  spatially,  with  some 
areas  characterized  by  increased  species  richness  while  others  show 
declines.  Future  range  changes  are  predicted  to  vary  among  species  and 
among different future projections, from the loss of the entire range (Tarentola 
mindiae  and  Hemidactylus  robustus)  to  large  gains  in  range  (Hemidactylus 
flaviviridis). No species was predicted to lose its entire currently suitable range 
under  all  scenarios.  Tarentola  mindiae  and  Hemidactylus  robustus  were 
predicted  to  become  extinct  from  Egypt  in  the  future  in  at  least  one  future 
projection.  Another  eight  species  were  predicted  to  lose  more  than  80%  of 
their  current  distribution  in  the  future.  According  to  IUCN  guidelines  and 
III 
 
criteria,  under  current  conditions,  three  species  were  classified  as  nationally 
Endangered and 24 species as Vulnerable.  
Although Protected Areas have greater conservation value compared to 
unprotected areas, Egypt’s Protected-Areas network seems to be inadequate 
to conserve Egyptian reptiles.  My results suggest the need  to construct  new 
Protected  Areas  in  a  variety  of  places  across  northern  Egypt  from  between 
Mersa Matruh and Sallum to the Gebel El-Hallal area in northern Sinai. Some  
Protected Areas require stricter protection in the future to counter the threats 
derived from climate change.

Introduction 
 
Detailed  information  on  the  ecological  and  geographical  distributions  of 
species  is  essential  for  conservation  planning  and  forecasting  (Elith  et  al. 
2006)  especially  for  species  facing  conservation  problems  (Pineda  &amp;  Lobo 
2009). Species distribution modelling is one of many methods used to quantify 
patterns of species distributions and to extrapolate distributions across space 
and time (Elith &amp; Leathwick 2007; Franklin 2009), usually based on a statistical 
model (Franklin 2009). This is done, basically, through a class of methods that 
combine  known  species  observations  (occurrence  or  abundance  at  known 
locations) with layers of environmental variables (and/or spatial characteristics 
of those locations) that are thought to have an influence on habitat suitability 
(and so species distribution) to make a model of the environmental conditions 
that  meet  the  ecological  requirements  of  a  species,  thus  identifying  where 
these suitable conditions are distributed in space (Phillips et al. 2006; Pearson 
2007;  Elith  &amp;  Leathwick  2009;  Franklin  2009;  Warren  &amp;  Seifert  2011).  The 
output  of  most  models  aims  to  provide  detailed  predicted  distribution  maps 
(Elith et al. 2006). 
  The  earliest  attempts  at  modelling  species  distributions  using 
correlations between the  observed distribution  and climate  were  by Johnston 
(1924), who predicted the invasive spread of cactus in Australia, and Hintikka 
(1963),  who  assessed  the  climatic  determinants  of  the  distribution  of  some 
European  species  based  on  the  minimum  and  maximum  temperatures 
(Pearson &amp; Dawson 2003; Guisan &amp; Thuiller 2005). Recent years have seen 
an explosion of interest in species distribution modelling, with the publishing of 
hundreds of studies and governmental and non-governmental reports that use 
them  (Franklin  2009).  Species  distribution  models  have  been  used  in  the 
literature  under  many  different  names  including  bioclimatic  models,  climate 
envelopes,  species  niche  models,  ecological  niche  models,  niche-theory 
models, habitat models, resource selection functions, range maps and spatial 
models (Elith &amp; Leathwick 2009; Franklin 2009). They can also be referred to 
as  habitat suitability models, since  they are said to describe the suitability of 
the habitat for a particular species (Hirzel &amp; Le Lay 2008; Franklin 2009). 
- 2 - 
  They represent an approximation of the ecological niche by estimating 
the  fundamental  (physiological  or  potential)  niche,  realized  (ecological  or 
actual)  niche  or,  when  based  only  on  climate  variables,  the  &#34;climatic  niche&#34; 
(Phillips  et  al.  2006;  Franklin  2009).  According  to  Hutchinson  (1957),  the 
fundamental niche of a species is the set of all conditions that allow long-term 
survival  and  reproduction,  also  called  an  &#34;n-dimensional  hypervolume&#34; 
because of the multiple axes of the defining conditions. The realized niche, on 
the other hand, is the portion of the fundamental niche that a species actually 
occupies and from which the species is not excluded due to biotic interactions 
(Pulliam  2000;  Phillips  et  al.  2006;  Pearson  2007).  The  realized  niche  of  a 
species  is  a  subset  of  the  fundamental  niche,  usually  but  not  always  due  to 
human  disturbance,  biotic  interactions  (competition  and  predation),  or  the 
existence  of  geographical  barriers  that  have  prevented  the  dispersal  and 
colonization  of  the species (Phillips  et  al. 2006;  Franklin 2009). According to 
Hutchinson’s definition of the realized niche, and assuming that the records do 
not come from a sink habitat (where populations cannot be maintained without 
immigrants from  elsewhere (Franklin 2009)), the  occurrence records where  a 
species  has  been  recorded  (and  subsequently  the  environmental 
characteristics  of  these  locations)  represent  a  sample  of  the  realized  niche 
(Phillips  et  al.  2006).  Using  that  sample  together  with  one  of  the  various 
possible  algorithms,  we  can  estimate  the  realized  niche  and  the  empirical 
correlation  between  distribution  and  environmental  variables  (Phillips  et  al. 
2006; Franklin 2009). In reality, the predicted distribution does not fully reflect 
the requirements and realized niche of the species because of various factors 
not  incorporated  into  the  model  (such  as  biotic  interactions,  geographic 
barriers  and species  history).  Because  of  this,  distribution  models  should  be 
interpreted with caution (Pearson &amp; Dawson 2003; Pearson et al. 2007) . 
  Recently,  species  distribution  models  have  developed  into  innovative 
and  valuable  techniques  used  to  generate  biogeographical  information 
applicable  to  various  fields  including  conservation  biology,  ecological 
restoration,  biodiversity  assessment,  reserve planning  and  design,  evolution, 
resource management and habitat management and restoration (Phillips et al. 
2006;  Pearson  2007;  Franklin  2009).  In  poorly  surveyed  areas,  they  can  be 
used  to  direct  additional  surveys  or  discover  new  species  (Raxworthy  et  al. 
- 3 - 
2003).  They  have  proven  themselves  to  be  an  important  component  in 
predicting  the  potential  anthropogenic  effects  on  biodiversity  (Guisan  &amp; 
Thuiller 2005) and assessing the invasive potential of non-native species (Elith 
et  al.  2006).  Another  growing  application  is  to  predict  the  distributions  of 
harmful pests  and disease hosts and  vectors that  affect humans, plants,  and 
animals,  providing  information  on  the  potential  distribution  or  outbreaks  of 
these pathogens and thus supporting public health and epidemiology (Franklin 
2009)  (examples  include:  Kelly  &amp;  Meentemeyer  2002;  Levine  et  al.  2004; 
Saathoff et al. 2005; Peterson 2006; Zeilhofer et al. 2007; Meentemeyer et al. 
2011). 
  Here I first review the way in which species distribution models use data 
and the choice of algorithm, and then look at ways of validating such models. I 
then consider in more detail the algorithm that I chose to use, called MaxEnt, 
before  reviewing  the  ways  in  which  distribution  models  have  been  used  to 
predict  future  changes  in  biodiversity  under  the  assumptions  of  models  of 
climate  change.  I  end  with  a  section  about  the  relevance  of  this  work  to  the 
Egyptian fauna  together  with the  very few previous studies  of the impacts  of 
climate change on Egypt’s biodiversity. 
 
Issues about the data required for distribution models 
Species  distribution  models  require  two  sorts  of  data  input:  biological  data 
describing  the  current  known  species  distribution  and  predictor  variables 
describing the  environmental  conditions  thought  to  affect  species  distribution 
(Pearson 2007; Phillips &amp; Dudik 2008). These two data input components are 
usually  in  the  format  suitable  for  visualizing  on  a  Geographic  Information 
System (GIS). The biological data usually come in the form of geo-databases 
containing the georeferenced records of the occurrences of species, while the 
predictor  variables  usually  come  in  the  form  of  GIS  raster  grids.  The  most 
common  predictor  variables  are  those  related  to  climate  (e.g.  temperature, 
precipitation),  topography  (e.g.  elevation,  aspect,  slope),  soil  type  and  land 
cover type (Phillips  et  al.  2006).  Some  studies  also  use  variables  describing 
the  distribution  of  interacting  species  to  improve  model  accuracy  (Newbold 
2010). Predictor variables come into two formats: continuous (any value within 
- 4 - 
a certain range; e.g. altitude, temperature or precipitation) or categorical (only 
a limited number  of  discrete  values;  e.g. habitat,  vegetation type,  land cover 
and soil) (Phillips et al. 2006; Phillips &amp; Dudik 2008). 
  In  the  context  of  species  distribution  models,  there  are  two  types  of 
biological data, either presence-only or presence/absence data. Presence-only 
data  represent  only  where  the  species  has  actually  been  collected  or 
recorded:  they  do  not  provide  information  on  where  it  was  not  recorded.  In 
contrast,  presence-absence  data,  in  addition  to  presence  records,  indicate 
areas where the species was not recorded during surveys. Presence-only data 
constitute  the  majority  of  existing  records  (Phillips  et  al.  2006;  Elith  &amp; 
Leathwick  2007),  and  are  somewhat  easier  to  collect.  The  main  sources  of 
presence-only  data  are  those  extracted  from  museum  collections,  herbaria, 
personal collections, planned surveys, casual observations, published articles 
and  reports,  and  online  databases  (e.g.  the  Global  Biodiversity  Information 
Facility,  see:  http://www.gbif.org/).  In recent  years,  data  from  many  museum 
and  herbaria  collections  have  become  available  online  over  the  internet 
(Graham et al. 2004; Newbold 2010). Most of these occurrence records were 
recorded  without  systematic  planning,  and  collection  methods  are  rarely 
known  (Elith  et  al.  2006).  Most  museum  databases,  for  example,  give 
information  on  where  the  specimens  were  collected,  but  usually  not  on  the 
location  of  surveys  that  failed  to  record  a  particular  species  (Stockwell  &amp; 
Peters  1999).  These  data,  when  used  with  caution,  can  give  invaluable 
information  on  patterns  of  distribution  (Newbold  2010)  and  be  effective  in 
calibrating distribution models for many species and regions (Elith et al. 2006). 
  Presence-absence records, on the other hand, are rarely available and 
are  often  difficult  to  obtain  accurately,  especially  in  poorly  surveyed  areas 
where modelling may hold greatest  value (Hirzel et al. 2002; Anderson et  al. 
2003; Phillips et al. 2006; Pearson 2007). Absence records may be unreliable 
or  of  questionable  value  in  many  situations  (Phillips  et  al.  2006;  Pearson 
2007): failure to detect a particular species may simply be due to inadequate 
collecting  effort  (Anderson  2003;  Graham  et  al.  2004),  or  when  the  target 
species  can  be  easily  missed  during  the  surveys  (rare  and  highly  mobile 
species)  (Pearson  et  al.  2007;  Rödder  et  al.  2011).  These  cases  are  often 
called  ‘false  absences’,  and  if  used  as  input,  the  distribution  model  will 
- 5 - 
interpret  the  predictor  values  of  these  locations  as  unsuitable  environmental 
conditions,  even  though  this  is  not  true  (Pearson  2007).  This  can  cause 
serious bias in the model analyses, so absence records should be used with 
caution (Hirzel et al. 2002; Pearson 2007). 
  There  are  some  other  potential  sources  of  bias  and  error  associated 
with biological data that should be carefully considered when collating records 
(Pearson  2007).  For  example,  there  can  be  error  through  incorrect 
identification  of species (Graham et al. 2004; Pearson 2007; Newbold  2010). 
Incorrect  identification  of  specimens  from  museums  and  collections  can  be 
detected  by  re-examining  the  original  specimens  (Newbold  2010).  There  is 
also  a  certain  degree  of  uncertainty  and  error  with  spatial  referencing  of 
samples.  Historic  data,  for  example,  often  have  location  descriptions  that 
represent  only  a  coarse  estimate  of  the  true  location,  in  contrast  to  more 
recent records from the last 20 years many of which have been georeferenced 
with GPS technology with location precision down to 1 m (Reside et al. 2011). 
Other  errors  include  transcribing  mistakes  while  transferring  data  from  field 
sheets  to  electronic  databases  (some  of  which  are  correctable  by  data 
cleaning)  and  transliterating  site  names  from  local  language  into  Latin script 
(especially  from  particular  languages  such  as  Arabic,  which  has  no  official 
method  of  transliteration  into  English:  every  writer  performs  a  new 
transliteration  as  if  from  scratch  (Gilbert  &amp;  Zalat  2008)).  Georeferencing  the 
records can introduce further errors; the textual description of the location may 
be very far from precise, describing a very broad or vague area (e.g. Egypt or 
Western desert) or include an ill-defined offset (e.g. 15 km NE of Wadi Feiran). 
In  such  cases  there  are  additional  sources  of  uncertainty:  errors  with 
measuring  the  extent  of  the  area  name,  the  direction  and  the  measure  of 
distance  (Wieczorek  et  al.  2004;  Graham  et  al.  2008;  Newbold  2010).  In 
certain situations,  the  collector  may  not  have  provided  enough  details  of  the 
recording  sites,  and  often  there  can  be  several  sites  with  the  same  name  in 
the  study  area.  For  example,  there  are  two  widely  separated  areas  in  Egypt 
named  Gebel  El-Ahmar  (in  South  Sinai  and  Giza  governorate):  mistakenly 
locating a record in the wrong location has the potential to cause great error in 
the model, especially if dealing with endemic species or species with restricted 
- 6 - 
ranges.  In  such  cases,  the  safest  way  is  to  ignore  the  record,  unless  more 
details can be found that establish which site is correct. 
  Presence-only  records  are  usually  highly  non-random  in  space  and 
time,  especially  those  derived  from  casual  observations  or  Natural  History 
museums and herbaria (Franklin 2009). This introduces another source of bias 
to  the  model,  of  which there  are four  types:  spatial,  environmental,  temporal 
and  taxonomic  (Soberón  et  al.  2000;  Newbold  2010).  Records  are  often 
collected closer to cities, roads, rivers, and coasts (Soberón et al. 2000; Reddy 
&amp;  Dávalos  2003;  Kadmon  et  al.  2004;  Newbold  2010)  than  a  truly  random 
sample.  They  tend  also  to  be  close  to  the  homes  of  the  active  recorders 
(Dennis &amp; Thomas 2000; Newbold 2010) or in areas that are of high interest, 
such as Protected Areas or biodiversity hotspots (Newbold 2010). The records 
may also show spatial correlation (if collected from several nearby localities in 
a restricted area) (Phillips et al. 2006). Collectors also are more likely to focus 
on  larger,  easy-to-identify  or charismatic  organisms, causing substantial  bias 
in sampling towards flowering plants and vertebrates (Newbold 2010).  
 
The choice of model algorithms 
A  wide  variety  of  modelling  algorithms  has  been  used  recently  (Guisan  &amp; 
Thuiller  2005;  Pearson  2007).  Some  methods  are  based  on  statistical 
regression  methods  (e.g.  generalized  linear  models,  generalized  additive 
models,  multivariate  adaptive  regression  splines),  whilst  others  depend  on 
machine-learning  methods  (decision  trees,  artificial  neural  networks,  genetic 
algorithms,  maximum  entropy  and  support  vector  machines)  (Pearson  2007; 
Franklin  2009).  Some  of  these  algorithms  have  been  developed  in  user-
friendly  free  software  (Pearson  2007)  (e.g.  Maxent).  Algorithms  that  include 
the possibility of interactions between predictors are considered more suitable 
(Elith  et  al.  2006;  Pearson  2007).  Some  studies  have  founded  that  different 
modelling  algorithms  can  potentially  produce  different  predictions  (Pearson 
2007;  Pearson  et  al.  2007;  Wisz  et  al.  2008),  and  that  the  best  performing 
model is not always the same for all species (Luoto et al. 2005; Grenouillet et 
al.  2011),  so  it  is  important  to  select  the  most  appropriate  method  for  the 
species being studied (Pearson et al. 2007). 
- 7 - 
  Distribution-model  algorithms  vary  in  their  data  requirements.  Many 
require both presence  and  absence records (e.g. GLM),  while  others can be 
carried  out  without  absence  records  (e.g.  BIOCLIM,  DOMAIN,  Maxent) 
(Pearson  2007).  For  presence-only  models,  instead  of  using  real  absence 
records (especially in poorly surveyed areas where absent records are usually 
not  available),  the  model  is  applied  by  sampling  pseudo-absences  from  the 
background study area (Pearson 2007; Pearson et al. 2007). Model algorithms 
also vary in their output formats; some are continuous (yielding a probability of 
occurrence between 0 and 1), while others give a binary prediction (suitable / 
unsuitable or presence / absence) (Pearson 2007). 
  In general, predictions calibrated with fewer records  are unlikely  to be 
as  good  as those  based  on  large numbers (Wisz et al.  2008;  Franklin 2009) 
because  when  the  sample  size  is  small,  outliers  give  more  weight  to  the 
analysis  than  if  a  greater  number  of  records  compensates  for  their  effect. 
Larger  numbers  of  records  can  describe  complex  relationships  and 
requirements (Wisz et al. 2008). There is no minimum fixed number of records 
required to run an acceptable model (Franklin 2009); some studies have found 
that 50-100 records are enough to produce an acceptable model, while some 
methods, (e.g. Maxent) seem to give reasonable prediction performance when 
calibrated  with  many  fewer  records  (Wisz  et  al.  2008;  Franklin  2009)  (see 
below). 
 
Assessing model performance 
Assessing model performance is a vital step in model development (Pearson 
2007).  It  helps  to  determine  the  suitability  of  the  model  for  particular 
applications,  and to compare  different models (Pearson 2007). Nevertheless, 
model performance is just  one  aspect  of  model evaluation,  and other criteria 
should be considered, such as ecological realism, spatial pattern of error, and 
model credibility (acceptability to the user community) (Franklin 2009). 
  It  is  preferable  to  use  new  independent  data  in  model  validation 
(Pearson  2007; Pearson et  al. 2007; Franklin  2009). Sometimes  this is done 
by collecting  new independent data from different  areas (e.g. Newbold  et al. 
2010), spatial resolution,  or time period,  or  by using  data from  other surveys 
- 8 - 
(Pearson  2007).  Using  the  same  data for  running  and  evaluating  the model 
results in overestimating the predictive performance (Franklin 2009). However, 
it  is  often  not  feasible  or  cost-effective  to  collect  new  independent  data  for 
validation (Franklin 2009). In this situation it is very common to divide the data 
into  two sets prior to the running the  model,  a training (calibration)  set  and  a 
testing  (evaluation)  set.  The  partitions  can  be  either  at  random  or  spatially 
(Pearson  2007;  Franklin  2009).  The  training  set  is  used  to  build  the  model, 
while the testing set is used for model validation (Franklin 2009). The relative 
sizes  of  the  two  sets  is  somewhat  arbitrary  and  depend  on  the  number  of 
record  locations,  although  using  75%  for  training  and  25%  for  testing  has 
become common (Pearson 2007). 
  An alternative to a one-time split is to split the data into partitions many 
times;  this  is  included  in  cross-validation,  subsampling,  and  bootstrapping 
methods. In cross-validation, the occurrence records are randomly split into a 
number  of  equal-sized  sets  (&gt;2)  and  the  model  is  calibrated  by  leaving  out 
each set in turn,  which is then used for  evaluation (Pearson  2007;  Phillips &amp; 
AT&amp;T Research 2011).  The validation statistic can be calculated as the mean 
of  the  replicated  models.  A  big  advantage  of  cross-validation  over  one-time 
splitting of the data is that it uses all of the data for validation (Phillips &amp; AT&amp;T 
Research  2011).  For  rare  species  where  the  species  has  just  a  few 
occurrence  records  (&lt;20),  an  extreme  form  of  cross-validation  is 
recommended,  using  &#39;jackknifing&#39;  (Pearson  2007),  where  the  model  is 
repeatedly run  omitting  each record in turn,  with the  omitted record used for 
testing (Baldwin 2009). Jackknifing can be used with larger sample sizes, but 
creates  an  over-optimistic  estimate  of  predictive  power  (Baldwin  2009). 
Another  alternative  is  to  use  repeated  subsamples,  in  which  the  data  are 
repeatedly split randomly into training and testing subsets without replacement 
(Phillips  &amp;  AT&amp;T  Research  2011).  In  bootstrapping,  the  training  data  are 
randomly selected by sampling with replacement for multiple times (the same 
record  is  used  in  testing  more  than  once)  (Pearson  2007;  Phillips  &amp;  AT&amp;T 
Research 2011).  
  Several test statistics have been used to measure model performance, 
often derived from the presence/absence confusion matrix (Table 1) (Pearson 
et  al.  2007).  The  confusion  matrix  requires  binary  model  predictions  (i.e. 
- 9 - 
presence/absence), not continuous prediction (Pearson 2007; Franklin 2009). 
The confusion matrix uses the frequencies of each of the four possibilities: true 
positive, where the model predicts a species as present and the data confirms 
it; false positive, where the model predicts a species as present and the data 
shows absence; false negative, where the model predicts a species as absent 
and  the  data shows  present;  and  true  negative,  where the  model  predicts  a 
species as absent and the data also show absence (Pearson 2007).

It is common in distribution modelling to convert from continuous output 
(probability  of  occurrence)  to  categorical  (presence/absence  or  suitable/non-
suitable),  conventionally  done  by  using  a  threshold  value  (Franklin  2009). 
Subsequently,  so-called  &#39;threshold-dependent&#39;  measures  can  be  used  to 
evaluate models, or alternatively continuous probabilistic predictions can also 
be evaluated, so-called &#39;threshold-independent&#39; measures (Franklin 2009). 
The  confusion  matrix,  and  statistics  used  to  test  model  performance 
derived from it, requires binary predictions (presence/absence). Thus it is often 
necessary  to  convert  the  probabilities  obtained  from  continuous  models  to 
binary predictions by using this threshold (Pearson 2007). Various alternative 
methods have  been employed  to select the  best  value for the threshold (see 
Table  2  for  some  examples).  The  simplest  is  to  use  a  fixed  arbitrary  value, 
above  which  the  species  is  deemed  present;  by convention  this  threshold is 
set to  0.5 (Pearson  2007; Franklin  2009). However, this  method  is the  worst 
and  lacks  any  ecological  justification  or  reasoning  (Liu  et  al.  2005;  Pearson 
2007).  Liu  et  al.  (2005)  evaluated  the  use  of  different  threshold  criteria, 
reporting that five threshold criteria performed equally well and better than the 
others:  observed  prevalence,  average  predicted  probability,  the  sum  of 
sensitivity and specificity, sensitivity specificity quality approach, and the point 
on the ROC plot nearest the upper left corner. 
- 10 - 
For  presence-only  models,  some  studies  favored  using  &#34;lowest 
predicted  threshold&#34;,  which  equals  the  lowest  predicted  value  of  any  of  the 
presence records used to run the model (Pearson et al. 2007); this sometimes 
called  minimum training  presence.  It  is  a  conservative  threshold  that  can  be 
interpreted ecologically (Pearson et  al. 2007),  but  because  it predicts that  all 
training  records  are  correctly  predicted,  this  may  yield  over-prediction 
(Jarnevich  &amp;  Reynolds  2011).  A  more  conservative  threshold  can  be  used, 
such  as  the  value  above  which  90%  of  the  training  records  are  correctly 
classified (10 percentile training presence value) (Jarnevich &amp; Reynolds 2011); 
this  rejects  10%  of  the  training  records  with  lowest  predicted  probability  as 
unsuitable, considered appropriate since they may represent recording errors, 
migrants or ephemeral populations (Morueta-Holme et al. 2010). 
 
Table  2:  Some  alternative  criteria  commonly  used  to  convert  probability 
distributions to binary forms (thresholded). 
 
  Fixed threshold: e.g. 0.5 
  Sensitivity= Specificity 
  Maximum Sensitivity plus Specificity 
  Maximum Kappa 
  Maximum percent correct classification (PCC) 
  Predicted prevalence = observed prevalence 
  observed prevalence 
  mean or median predicted probability  
  minimizing the distance between the ROC curve and the upper left corner of 
the ROC plot 
  Weighting  omission  and commission  errors  by  their  costs  relative  to  a  given 
application of the model 
  Maximum  Sensitivity  (Specificity)  that  also  achieves  user-defined  minimum 
Specificity (Sensitivity) 
 
  Of the various ways of measuring model accuracy (Table 3), one simple 
and easy way is to calculate the percent correct classification, by dividing the 
sum  of  the  diagonals  of  the  confusion  matrix  (true  positives  and  true 
negatives) by the number of the observations (Pearson 2007; Franklin 2009). 
Although its concept is easy and logic, there are two problems with it: first, it 
does not distinguish between false negatives and false positives; second, it is 
possible to get high accuracy using a poor model when a species’ prevalence 
(proportion  or  frequency)  is  relatively  high  or  low  (Pearson  2007;  Franklin 
2009).  To  overcome  this  problem,  a  similar  measure  of  accuracy  has  been 
used,  called  Kappa,  which  is  considered  as  a  measure  of  categorical 
agreement that describes the difference between the observed agreement and 
chance  agreement  with  the  proportion  of  correct  predictions  expected  by 
- 11 - 
chance taken into account (Pearson 2007; Franklin 2009). Kappa, along with 
AUC  (see  below),  is  more  suitable  to  evaluate  models  in  poorly  surveyed 
regions, where absence data are not available (Pearson et al. 2007). The ‘true 
skill statistic’ is  another  method  of  measuring  model accuracy, suggested  as 
an alternative to kappa if a threshold-dependent measure is needed (Franklin 
2009):  it  is  reported  to  be  independent  of  the  species  prevalence  and  so 
considered more appropriate than kappa (Baldwin 2009).

When model output is continuous and a particular threshold measure is 
used to convert it to categorical (binary) output, the statistics derived from the 
confusion  matrix  will  be  sensitive  to  the  threshold  method  used  (Pearson 
2007). It would be useful to have a single measure of model performance that 
is  independent  of  the  threshold  choice  (Phillips  et  al.  2006);  such  measures 
could  then  be  used  to  compare  modelling  methods,  species,  candidate 
predictors,  etc.  (Franklin  2009).  One  of  the  most  frequently  used  such 
statistics  in  species  distribution  modelling  is  the  AUC  -  the  Area  Under  the 
ROC  (receiver  operating  characteristic)  Curve  (Elith  et  al.  2006;  Elith  &amp; 
Leathwick 2007). 
  The  AUC  is  derived  from  the  receiver  operating  characteristic  (ROC) 
curve (Baldwin 2009). The ROC curve is defined by plotting the false-positive 
error rate (1 - specificity) on the x-axis versus the true positive rate (sensitivity) 
- 12 - 
on  the  y-axis  across  a range  of  possible  threshold  values  (Fig.  1)  (Pearson 
2007; Franklin 2009). 
The  AUC  value  can  be  interpreted  as  the  probability  that  when  a 
presence site  and  absence site are randomly chosen, the former will have  a 
higher  predicted  value  (Elith  et  al.  2006;  Elith  &amp;  Leathwick  2007;  Franklin 
2009).  An AUC  value  of  0.8  means  that  there  is  a  probability  of  80%  that  a 
randomly  selected  presence  record  has  a  greater  predicted  value  than  a 
randomly selected absence (Pearson 2007; Wisz et al. 2008). The AUC value 
is calculating by measuring the area under the ROC curve, and ranges from 0 
to  1.  An AUC score of  1 indicates  a perfect  model  i.e.  perfect discrimination 
between  presences  and  absences;  a  model  with  AUC  of  0.5  indicates  a 
discriminating ability no better than random; an AUC value &lt;0.5 indicates the 
model performs worse than random, i.e. the model may fit the modelling data 
but it predicts badly (Elith et al. 2006; Elith &amp; Leathwick 2007; Pearson 2007; 
Franklin  2009).  A  model  of  AUC  score  of  0.5  to  0.7  has  been  used  as 
indication  of  poor  performance,  0.7  to  0.9  is  moderate,  and  &gt;0.9  is  high 
(Franklin  2009).  The  AUC  is  not  influenced  by  species  prevalence,  and 
therefore  is  reliable  for  model  comparisons  (Phillips  et  al.  2006;  Franklin 
2009); such comparisons are valid only between models and sample sizes of 
the same species and study area (Wisz et al. 2008).

  In  cases  where  only  presence  data  are  available,  almost  all  the 
measures discussed above can be applied by testing the ability of the model 
to  discriminate  accurately  between  presence  and  background  (also  called 
pseudo-absence)  data,  although  they  should  be  interpreted  differently 
(Franklin 2009). In such cases, AUC, for example, could be interpreted as the 
probability of the model scoring a random presence site higher than a random 
pseudo-absence or background site (Franklin 2009). 
All  methods  defined  from  the  confusion  matrix  (including  kappa  and 
AUC), are flawed and are unsuitable to be used when only presence data are 
available (Boyce et al. 2002; Pearson et al. 2007). AUC, for example, is not an 
absolute  measure  and  is  sensitive  to  the  method  used  to  determine  the 
absence data during the evaluation (Wisz et al. 2008) and may often give poor 
model performance because of low classification success (Boyce et al. 2002). 
Its  value  tend  to  be  higher  for  species  with  narrower  ranges  relative  to  the 
study area, which does not necessarily mean that the model is better (Phillips 
&amp;  AT&amp;T  Research  2011).  In  statistical  modelling  the  usual  method  of 
assessing the model fit is the Akaike Information Criterion, or AIC. This strikes 
a balance  between fitting  the data  as  well as possible (which can  always be 
improved by using more predictor variables), and parismony (which is taken to 
mean the fewest number of predictors). It is used to  arrive  at  the  best set  of 
predictors  from  a  panel  of  possibilities,  refining  an  individual  model,  but 
comparing  models  with  different  response  variables  cannot  be  done.  Thus 
here the use of AIC is not very useful. 
 
Maximum entropy modelling (Maxent) 
Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method for making inferences 
or predictions from incomplete information (Phillips et al. 2006; Baldwin 2009). 
It estimates the most uniform distribution (maximum entropy) subject to a set 
of  constraints  that  represent  our  incomplete  information  about  the  target 
distribution  (Phillips  et  al.  2006).  It  is  being  applied  in  a  variety  of  fields 
including  finance  and  astronomy  (Franklin  2009).  Since  2004  it  has  been 
applied  extensively  to  model  species  distributions  because  it  shows  high 
predictive accuracy and enjoys several additional attractive properties (Phillips 
- 14 - 
&amp;  Dudik  2008;  Franklin  2009).  It  has  been  used  in  a  variety  of  applications 
including  predicting  species  richness  (Graham  &amp;  Hijmans  2006;  Pineda  &amp; 
Lobo  2009),  invasive  species  (Ficetola  et  al.  2007;  Ward  2007),  estimating 
species extent of occurrence (Sergio et al. 2007), and the quality of protection 
of rare species (DeMatteo &amp; Loiselle 2008; Thorn et al. 2009). 
  Maxent can produce three output formats (raw, cumulative and logistic), 
but  the  logistic  format  improves  model  calibration  and  so  is  highly 
recommended over the two other formats: it provides an estimate of probability 
of  presence  as  predicted  by  the  environmental  variables,  and  thus  large 
differences in the values correspond to large differences  in habitat suitability 
(Phillips  &amp;  Dudik  2008;  Baldwin  2009).  The  logistic  format  provides  output 
values  ranged  from  0  to  1  and  is  easier  to  interpret  when  projected  to 
Geographic  Information  System  (GIS)  (Baldwin 2009).  All the  three types  of 
the  output  formats  are  monotonically  related  but  are  scaled  differently  and 
have different interpretations (Phillips &amp; AT&amp;T Research 2011);  all  pixels  will 
be ranked in the same order, resulting in identical performance when a rank-
based statistic is used (e.g. AUC), but will vary in predictive performance when 
using  a  measure  that  depends  on  the  actual  output  value  (e.g.  Pearson’s 
correlation) (Phillips &amp; Dudik 2008; Baldwin 2009). 
  Several  studies  have  shown  that  Maxent  performs  well in comparison 
with  alternative  algorithms  and shows  higher predictive  accuracy  (Elith  et  al. 
2006; Hernandez et al. 2006; Pearson et al. 2007; Wisz et al. 2008; Franklin 
2009;  Pineda  &amp;  Lobo  2009).  According  to  Phillips  et  al.  (2006),  the  main 
advantages  of  Maxent  are  that  it  requires  only  presence  records  along  with 
predictor variables for the whole study area; it is able to use both continuous 
and  categorical  environmental  data  (Baldwin  2009);  it  can  fit  interactions 
between  different  predictor  variables;  it  is  based  on  a concise  mathematical 
definition;  over-fitting  can  be  avoided  by  using  standard  methods  (called 
regularization);  prediction  output  is  continuous;  and it  can  also  be  applied to 
presence/absence data by using conditional models. Maxent has been shown 
to be very robust to small numbers of training records and outperforms other 
algorithms when using a relatively small number of occurrence records (Wisz 
et  al.  2008;  Franklin  2009).  It  has  been  reported  as  producing  accurate 
predictions  using  as  few  as  20-30 records  (Feeley  &amp;  Silman  2011);  in  some 
- 15 - 
cases as few as five records can calibrate a model, but such models should be 
interpreted  with  great  caution  and  be  used  to  point  out  areas  where  future 
surveys  should  focus  (Baldwin  2009).  It  is  also  robust  against  moderate 
location errors accompanying species records, outperforming other algorithms 
(Graham et al. 2008). In some studies that compare the accuracy of different 
algorithms,  Maxent  was  shown  to  outperform  GARP,  especially  with  small 
sample sizes (Franklin 2009). In Elith et al. (2006) comprehensive  study  that 
compares  the  accuracy  of  a  large  number  of  presence-only  algorithms, 
Maxent  was  among the top performers  and showed high predictive accuracy 
(Franklin  2009).  It  also  outperformed  GLM  and  GAM  when  applied  to 
presence/background  data,  and  was  much  better  than  BIOCLIM  (Franklin 
2009). 
  Maxent has some drawbacks, however. It is not as mature a statistical 
method  as  GLM  and  GAM,  and  hence  special-purpose  software  is  required 
because  it  is  not  available  in  standard  statistical  packages  (Phillips  et  al. 
2006). Maxent is disposed to overfitting (matching the input data too closely), 
yielding  predicted  distributions  with  high  values  clumped  around  the 
occurrence  points.  This  has  a  detrimental  effect  on  model  performance 
(Phillips  &amp;  Dudik  2008;  Baldwin  2009).  In  order  to  surmount  this  issue,  a 
number  of ‘regularization’ parameters have  been added to recent  versions  of 
Maxent  (Phillips  &amp;  Dudik  2008;  Baldwin  2009).  There  are  various  different 
settings that can be adjusted by the modeller, but recent studies have shown 
that  the  default  settings  work  perfectly  well  for  a  wide  range  of  species, 
environmental  conditions,  number  of  available  records  and  level  of  sample 
bias,  achieving  a  performance  just  as  good  as  the  models  that  result  from 
adjusted settings (Phillips &amp; Dudik 2008; Baldwin 2009). 
  It  is  important  to  know  how  each  variable  influences  the  model 
predictions,  and  which  has  the  greatest  influence  (Baldwin  2009).  Maxent 
provides  two  measures  of  variable  importance.  First,  it  estimates  the 
contribution of each variable using either: percent contribution and permutation 
importance (Table 4). Percent contribution shows how each variable contribute 
to the model, based on the particular path selected by the algorithm to get the 
optimal solution (different algorithms can get the same solution using different 
paths,  resulting  in  having  different  percent  contribution  values)  (Phillips  &amp; 
- 16 - 
AT&amp;T  Research  2011).  Permutation  importance  depends  only  on  the  final 
model,  not the path  used to get it. This  is calculated by randomly  permuting 
variable  values  among  presence  and  background  points  and  measuring  the 
resulting decline in training AUC, high AUC decline indicates high dependency 
of  the  model  of  that  variable (Phillips  &amp;  AT&amp;T  Research  2011).  Permutation 
importance is more favourable to estimate variables importance as it does not 
depend on the path used by the algorithm (Songer et al. 2012); although both 
values should be interpreted with caution because of collinearity - when using 
strongly  correlated  environmental  variables,  a  greater  importance  can  easily 
be attributed to one of two or more highly correlated variables (Baldwin 2009; 
Phillips  &amp;  AT&amp;T  Research 2011).  The  second  approach is  the  jackknife  test 
(Fig. 2), done by repeatedly running the model excluding each variable in turn, 
as  well  as  models  using  each  variable  in isolation  and  all  variables  together 
(Baldwin 2009; Phillips &amp; AT&amp;T Research 2011). This provides information on 
the relative strength  of  each variable, how  accurately each is  able  to  explain 
the distribution and how much unique information is provided by it (Yost et al. 
2008;  Baldwin 2009).  Maxent  also  provides  response  curves  describing  how 
each  variable  influences  the  probability  of  occurrence,  keeping  all  other 
variables  constant  at  their  average  value  (Baldwin  2009).  These  response 
curves  are  also  highly  affected  by  strong  collinearity  among  predictors 
(Baldwin 2009) (Fig. 3).

Climate change and biodiversity 
Over  the  last  century,  changes  of  Earth’s  climate  have  been  recorded, 
including  warmer  temperatures  (0.6  °C  increase  over  the  20
th
  century) 
accompanied  with  altered  geographical  and  seasonal  distribution  of 
precipitation (Araújo &amp; Rahbek 2006; Thuiller 2007; Alkemade et al. 2011). It is 
expected  that  climate  will  undergo  a  continuous  increase  in  temperature  of 
between  1  and  6  °C  during  the  21
st
  century  (Thuiller  2007;  Alkemade  et  al. 
2011). 
There is a widespread agreement that climate change has high impact 
on  the  survival  of  ecological  communities  and  individuals  (Suarez  &amp;  Tsutsui 
2004;  Alkemade  et  al.  2011);  and  that  biodiversity  is  continually  being 
transformed  in  response  to  it  (Hannah  et  al.  2005).  Even  though  recorded 
effects  of  climate  change  on  biodiversity  seem  to  be  generally  slower  than 
other factors, it is predicted that its effects will become increasingly prominent 
over the next 50 years and beyond (Thuiller 2007). The combination of habitat 
fragmentation  and  climate  change  is  the  most  threatening  aspect  of  climate 
change  impacts  on  biodiversity  and  species  conservation  (Hannah  et  al. 
2005). As climate changes, species (or populations) will be able to survive in 
novel environments if the new environmental conditions are within the species’ 
fundamental niches, or if species are able to adapt to these conditions if they 
are  outside  of  its  fundamental  niche  (Martínez-Meyer  2005).  In  other  words, 
the ability of a species to respond to climate change will be dependent on its 
ability to track climate changes, colonize new areas and modify its physiology 
and  seasonal  behavior  to  adapt  to  novel  environmental  conditions  (Thuiller 
2007). 
Responses  of  different  species  to climate  change can  be categorized 
into  three  non-exclusive  axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range),  and 
‘self’  (e.g.  physiology)  (Bellard  et  al.  2012).  Climate  change  has  been 
implicated in the last 40 years as the main cause for species’ distribution shifts 
and  the  extinction  (Thomas  et  al.  2004),  with  a  particularly  strong  impact  on 
butterflies,  birds  and  species  at  high  altitude  (Hannah  2011).  Some  climate 
change  model  forecasts  claim  that  15-37%  of  the  current  species  are 
committed  to  extinction  by  2050  (without  taking  in  consideration  biological 
factors;  e.g.  competition  and  evolutionary  history)  (Thuiller  2007).  Expected 
- 19 - 
species range shifts are generally polewards or towards higher altitudes, with 
each  temperature  increase  of  1 °C  predicted  to cause  a move  of  ecological 
zone by 160 km polewards or 0.16 km higher altitude (Thuiller 2007). Over the 
past  50  years,  the  range  of  terrestrial  plants  and  animals  in  the  northern 
hemisphere  has  been  shifted  on  average  by  6.1  km  northward  (or  6.1  m 
upwards)  each decade,  causing remarkable  increases  in  species  diversity  in 
some places in Europe over the last century (Thuiller 2007). Many European 
birds  and  butterflies,  for  example,  have  shifted  their  distributions  northwards 
by about 20 km and 150 km respectively from 1970 to 1990 (Alkemade et al. 
2011).  Range  shifts  of  flowering  plants  and pollinating  insect  species  due  to 
climate  change  will  cause  possible  mismatches  between  plant  and  pollinator 
populations; coupled with increased extinction risks to either of them, this will 
result in changes to insect-pollinator networks (Bellard et al. 2012), potentially 
causing  dramatic  changes  to  ecosystem  services.  Other  interspecific 
relationships  are  also  susceptible  to  such  modifications  (competition, 
predation,  parasitism  and  mutualism)  which  will  modify  community  structure 
and ecosystem functions (Bellard et al. 2012). Range shifts of introduced pest 
and pathogenic species due to climate change may have even more dramatic 
impacts on ecosystems, conservation and human life (Hannah 2011). Climate 
change has also resulted in changes to the timing of seasonal events of some 
species  e.g.  earlier  egg-laying  for  birds  (Crick  et  al.  1997;  Hughes  2000; 
Suarez &amp; Tsutsui 2004), bird migration, reproduction, planting and harvesting, 
fruiting and flowering times (Ibanez et al. 2006; Parmesan 2006). 
Several  extinction  incidents  recorded  in  the  recent  past  have  been 
claimed  as  the  results  of  climate  change.  The  first  documented  extinction 
linked to climate change occurred in 1987 when the formerly common Golden 
Toad  (Bufo  periglenes)  from  Costa  Rica  disappeared  (Hannah  2011).  As  a 
result  of  increasing  temperature,  it  is  expected  that  species  turnover  will 
increase  and the  proportion  of  the  range  of  species  that  will  remain  suitable 
under climate change will decrease in all biomes (Alkemade et al. 2011). 
  Species  distribution  models  have  been  widely  used  to  estimate  the 
potential  impacts  of climate change  on species distributions  and ecosystems 
(Coetzee  et  al.  2009;  Franklin  2009)  and  predict  potential  future  extinction 
risks. Once a model has been calibrated for current climate conditions, it can 
- 20 - 
be  projected  to  predict  the  potential  distributions  at  different  time  periods  (in 
the  future  or  the  past)  by  using  information  on  predicted  climates,  or  to 
different study areas in order to assess the potential locations where invasions 
are  more  likely  to  establish  (Franklin  2009).  This  helps  to  manage  species 
facing  possible future threats  by  identifying biological  corridors  for  dispersal, 
determining  sites  for  re-introduction  and  areas  requires  more  protection 
measures  (Thuiller  2007).  Several  studies  have  used  species  distribution 
models  to  show  the  effect  of  climate  change  on  the  whole  fauna  and  flora; 
such  predictions  are  challenging  tasks  because  this  involves  sources  of 
uncertainty:  in  the  data,  the  resolution,  which  algorithm  is  used  (different 
algorithms  may  produce  very  different  future  projections  even  if  they  give 
similar present-day models (Martínez-Meyer 2005)), and the global circulation 
model  (GCM)  used  to  create  predicted  climate  scenarios  (Carvalho  et  al. 
2010;  Guisan  &amp;  Rahbek  2011).  Validation  of  the  projected  results  is 
problematic,  because  predictions  are  made  for  events  that  have  not  yet 
occurred  (Araújo  &amp;  Pearson  2005).  Validation  can  be  done  by  projecting 
recent  past  distributions  of  some  species  to  current  conditions,  using  new 
records  as  independent  data  for  evaluation,  or  by  projecting  current 
distributions  back  to  the  distant  past  (e.g.  Pleistocene  climates)  and  using 
fossil  records  as  independent  data  for  evaluation  (Araújo  &amp;  Pearson  2005; 
Thuiller  2007).  In  most  cases,  the  availability  of  such  data  is  very  limited  to 
certain  geographical  areas  or  taxonomic  groups.  For  these  reasons,  results 
from such projection studies should be treated with great caution. 
It is  assumed  by  most  distribution models (projected in time  or space) 
that  the  climate  conditions  in  current  and  projected  models  are  analogous. 
When this assumption is violated, by extrapolating to conditions beyond those 
of  the  training  data  (non-analogous  climates),  inaccuracies  can  result,  with 
either over-prediction or under-prediction (Fitzpatrick et al. 2008; Richmond et 
al. 2010). A possible solution is to limit predictions in areas with novel climate 
conditions by applying so-called ‘clamping’ (Richmond et al. 2010). Clamping 
has become available in recent versions of Maxent, allowing the identification 
of the degree of uncertainty in projected models and showing areas where the 
model is less reliable because of extrapolation (Rödder et al. 2009; Holcombe 
et al. 2010). Using clamping in Maxent results in a constant response outside 
- 21 - 
the  maximum  and  minimum  limits  of  the  training  data,  by  constraining  the 
climate to remain at the limits of the training data (Phillips et al. 2006; Elith et 
al. 2010; Elith et al. 2011).  
  Forecast  results  using  different  model  algorithms  can  vary  quite  a  lot: 
fundamentally these models depend on correlations between environment and 
distribution,  and  thus  are  dependent  on  the  data  and  the  mathematical 
functions  used  to  predict  species  distributions  (Araújo  &amp;  New  2007).  In 
addition,  studies  have  shown  that  results  derived  from  different  species 
distribution modelling methods are not equally reliable for all species and that 
the best performing model is not always the same for all species (Luoto et al. 
2005;  Grenouillet  et  al.  2011).  To  reduce  the  effect  of  inter-model  variation, 
some  researchers  recommend  the  simultaneous  use  of  different  prediction 
methods  (and  climate  change  models  and  emission  scenarios)  within  a 
consensus  modelling  framework  (ensemble  or  consensus  modelling),  which 
they  claim  produces  more  robust  inference  and  prediction  (Araújo  &amp;  New 
2007; Coetzee et al. 2009; Grenouillet et al. 2011; Yen et al. 2011). The term 
consensus refers to  an  agreement  of different model outputs (Marmion  et al. 
2009). Using ensemble modelling helps to reduce the predictive uncertainty of 
a  single  model  and  potentially  to  improve  the  robustness  of  the  projections 
(Araújo  &amp; New  2007; Grenouillet et  al. 2011). It may  also  help to reduce the 
effect of model uncertainty and improve predictions for rare species (Guisan &amp; 
Rahbek  2011).  Ensemble  modelling  has  been  recently  used  in  broad-scale 
conservation  studies,  especially  to  check  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on 
different species (Marmion et al. 2009). BIOMOD (Thuiller et al. 2009) is one 
of  the  most-used  platforms  for  ensemble  modelling.  It  is  a  free  Cran-R  (R 
Development  Core  Team  2012)  package  that  enables  users  to  perform 
species  distribution  models  using  several  modelling  techniques  (including 
Maxent in most recent versions) and testing methods, including projecting the 
models into predicted future environmental conditions (Thuiller et al. 2009). 
 
Relevance to Egypt 
Predicted  impacts  of  climate  change  on  Egypt  include  the  raising  of  the  sea 
level  (which  will  affect  people  living  in Nile  Delta  and coastal  areas  in  Egypt 
- 22 - 
and  also  will  make  high  percentage  of  Egypt  flora  and  fauna  vulnerable  to 
extinction), changes in the distribution of vector-borne infectious diseases, and 
reduction  in the productivity  of  major crops (Parry  et al.  2007; Tolba &amp; Saab 
2009).  It  also  predicted  that  Egypt  will  be  vulnerable  to  water  stress  and 
increase  of  water  requirements,  uncertainty  of  Nile  flow,  and  increase  in 
irrigation demand under climate change (Parry et al. 2007). The water issue is 
a serious problem facing Egypt in the future because the country is mostly arid 
and depends on the Nile as the main source of drinking and irrigation water.  
  Tourism,  one  of  the  main  sources  of  Egypt  National  Income,  is  also 
predicted to be affected in the future by climate change (Tolba &amp; Saab 2009). 
The  number  of  tourists  coming  to  Egypt’s  coasts  each  year  is  expected  to 
decline  because  of  the  potential  impact  of  climate  change  on  coral  reefs. 
Worldwide,  almost  all  coral  reefs  have  been  affected  by  climate-change-
induced coral bleaching at one time or another (Hannah 2011). Corals depend 
on  a  certain  kind  of  algae  (zooxanthellae),  using  the  nutrients  they  produce 
while providing the algae with physical support, protection and maintenance in 
adequate level  of sunlight for photosynthesis (Hannah 2011). When exposed 
to  high  water  temperatures  (more  than  1  or  2°  C  rise  in  sea  surface 
temperature above normal summer maximal temperatures for a period longer 
than  3–5  weeks),  corals  expel  the  algae,  resulting  in  loss  of  coral  color 
(Hannah  et  al.  2005;  Hannah  2011).  Beside  its  conservation  implications, 
declines  in  the  number  of  tourists  will  have  great  impact  on  Egypt  National 
Income  and  a  relatively  high  proportion  of  Egyptians  working  in  tourism  will 
suffer.  
  Climate  change  will  potentially  affect  biodiversity  and  species 
composition of Egypt ecosystems (Tolba &amp; Saab 2009), although not enough 
studies or data are available on this (see below). It is predicted that Egypt will 
suffer from global changes in the distribution of flowering plants and pollinating 
insects due to climate change, which are predicted to cause dramatic declines 
in  the  ecosystem  services  they  provide.  We  do  have  an  estimate  of  the 
potential costs of such declines: the annual cost of losing Egyptian pollinators 
to the Egyptian National Income would be approximately L.E. 13.5 billion ($2.4 
billion, 3.3% of the 2003 GDP) (Brading et al. 2009).

  Only a handful of studies have been conducted with the use of species 
distribution  modelling  techniques  to  predict  the  potential  distribution  of 
Egyptian fauna and the potential impacts of climate chance on them: there are 
no such  published  studies  on  Egyptian  flora.  This  may  be  because that  the 
models  are  relatively  new  and  the  availability  of  biodiversity  data  records  of 
Egyptian  fauna  and  flora  are not  well  organized  and  sparse.  Gilbert  &amp;  Zalat 
(2008); Basuony et al. (2010), the main two publication of the BioMAP project 
(see:  http://biomapegypt.org),  discussed  the  distribution  of  each  Egyptian 
butterfly and mammal species respectively. In these two books, data on each 
species  were  collated  from  available  sources  and  an  actual  and  predicted 
distribution map for each species were provided (using Maxent); each species 
was  also assessed  according to the IUCN  guidelines  and criteria.  In another 
study, El Alqamy et al. (2010) used Maxent to predict the potential distribution 
of  the  Nubian  Ibex  (Capra  nubiana)  in  South  Sinai,  and  showed  that  the 
presence  of  water  was  the  environmental  factor  most  influential  in  their 
distribution in South Sinai. 
Three studies have discussed the effect of climate change on Egyptian 
species.  Hoyle  &amp;  James  (2005)  used  an  occupancy  model  (a  type  of 
population viability analysis) to assess the potential impacts of global warming 
on  the  world’s  smallest  butterfly,  the  Sinai  Baton  Blue  (Pseudophilotes 
sinaicus).  Just  two  recent  studies  have  used  species  distribution  models  to 
assess the effect of climate change on Egypt biodiversity. Soultan (2011) used 
Maxent  to  test  the  potential  impact  of  climate  change  on  the  distribution  of 
Egyptian  antelopes  (Barbary  sheep  Ammotragus  lervia,  Nubian  ibex  Capra 
nubiana, Dorcas gazelle Gazella dorcas, and Slender-horned gazelle Gazella 
leptoceros)  using  the  A2  and  B2  emission  scenarios  of  a Global  Circulation 
Models.  Leach  (2011)  discussed  the  effect  of  climate  change  on  Egyptian 
butterflies  and  mammals  (using  Maxent  algorithm  and  A2  and  B2  emission 
scenarios  of  a  different  Global  Circulation  Models),  and  considered  the 
effectiveness  of  the  Protected  Area  network  in  Egypt  in  conserving  Egypt 
biodiversity  under  current  and  future  climates  (using  Zonation  software).  No 
studies  have  been  published  on  the  use  of  species  distribution  models  to 
predict the potential distribution of Egyptian reptiles - the topic of this study.

Aim of study 
 
The main aims of this study are to: 
  prepare a distribution map of the records for each reptile species; 
  predict their potential distribution under the current climate; 
  predict  their  future  potential  distribution  under  climate  change  using  four 
global  circulation  models,  two  emission  scenarios,  three  time  slices  and 
two assumptions about dispersal ability; 
  estimate the pattern of species richness under current and future climates; 
  estimate areas predicted to have highest future gains / losses / turnover of 
species; 
  analyse the responses  to climate change and  assess future threat  status 
for each species; 
  assess current status according to IUCN guidelines and criteria; 
  assess the priority areas for conservation of Egyptian reptiles; 
  perform  a  gap  analysis  to  show  the  effectiveness  of  Egypt’s  Protected 
Areas network to conserve reptiles.

Methods 
 
Study area – Egypt 
Egypt  is  located  at  the  north  eastern  part  of  the  continent  of  Africa;  it  is 
situated  between  latitudes  22°  to  32°  N  and  longitudes  24°  to  37°  E.  It 
occupies an area of a little more than 1,000 kilometers square (1 million km
2
), 
constituting about 3 per cent  of Africa (Zahran &amp; Willis 2009 - See  Fig. 4 for 
the political boundaries of Egypt showing the main locations discussed in this 
study).  Geographically,  it  can  be  divided  into  four  units:  the  Nile  Valley  and 
Delta,  Western  Desert,  Eastern  Desert,  and  Sinai.  Most  of  Egypt’s  human 
population lives around the Nile and Delta because of the restricted availability 
of water and food elsewhere, which leaves a large proportion of Egypt’s land 
as  desolate  desert.  Relatively  small  settlements  are  sparsely  distributed  in 
Western Desert oases, the Red Sea coast, and Sinai. Egypt is one of if not the 
most arid country in the world; average annual rainfall across Egypt is just 10 
mm with a maximum of 200 mm at the Mediterranean coast (Zahran &amp; Willis 
2009). There are 30 Protected Areas in Egypt, compromising about 15% of the 
total area of Egypt (Fig. 5). 
 
Study species – Egyptian reptiles 
According to (Baha El Din 2006a), the most recent comprehensive publication 
on  the  Egyptian  herpetofauna,  the  contemporary  Egyptian  reptiles  include  at 
least 109 species: 61 lizards, 39 snakes, 1 crocodile, 7 turtles and a tortoise; 
in  addition  there is  a  recently  separated species,  Acanthodactylus  aegyptius 
(Baha El Din 2007). Data on species distribution were compiled from various 
different  sources.  The  main  source  was  records  extracted  from  the BioMAP 
project database [Biodiversity Monitoring and Assessment Project 2004-2008; 
see:  http://www.biomapegypt.org/];  one  of  BioMAP’s  main  aims  was  to 
develop  a comprehensive  database  of  existing  Egyptian  biodiversity  records 
derived  mainly  from  international  museum  records,  recent  literature,  and 
personal  collections.  For  Egyptian  reptiles,  the  collections  were  mainly  from 
two  well-known  Egyptian  herpetologists,  Dr.  Sherif  Baha  El  Din  and  Dr. 
- 26 - 
Mostafa  Saleh.  In  addition  to  BioMAP  database  records,  I  included  some 
further records from the sparse literature (a full list  of the  published literature 
used  is  given  in  Appendix  1).  I  also  involved  my  personal  sightings  from 
fieldwork surveys  done  in Sinai,  Gebel  Elba,  Nile Delta,  and  Eastern  desert 
(2005-2011). All these records were gathered into one preliminary database. 
Records  were  then  assessed  based  on  various  criteria  (mainly 
taxonomic and geographic). Species taxonomy was revised according to latest 
taxonomic  findings  (Baha  El  Din  2006a),  and  records  with  invalid 
unrecognizable  taxonomy  were  deleted.  Some  records  came  from  outside 
Egypt  and some  non-Egyptian species  had  erroneously  been included in  the 
database. Records for marine or Nile species (Nile crocodile and Sea Turtles) 
were  also  excluded  from  the  database  because  the  lack  of  GIS  predictor 
layers  for  aquatic  environments  meant  that  these  species  could  not  be 
involved in species distribution modelling. 
For  recent  records  coming  with  global  positioning  systems  (GPS) 
receiver  coordinates,  sighting  coordinates  were  double-checked  to  avoid 
possible  uncertainties  over  the  coordinate  system  used  (Newbold  2009), 
errors  accompanied  with  transferring  information  from  GPS  devices  or  field 
sheets to electronic databases or with unintentional swapping between latitude 
and  longitude.  All  other  records  were  then  georeferenced  to  the  nearest  5 
decimal  places  (when  possible)  using  topographic  maps,  gazetteers,  and 
Google  Earth®.  Records  with  vague  location  names  (e.g.  records  with  just 
Egypt, Eastern Desert, Western Desert, Sinai, South Sinai, etc.) could not be 
georeferenced  precisely  and  so  were  deleted  from  the  database.  Some 
locations  were  not  able  to  be  georeferenced,  i.e.  very  small  locations  or 
locations  with  local  names  that  could  not  be  identified  using  available 
topographic maps and gazetteers (e.g. small wadis or villages). These records 
were deleted from the database. 
All  valid  georeferenced  records  were  then  mapped  using 
ArcMap 10 (ESRI,  USA)  and  a  current  distribution  map  were  prepared  for 
each  species  (not  shown).  Current  species  distributions  were  then  checked 
and compared to those from (Baha El Din 2006a). Records from odd locations 
(outside the distribution range) were assigned as inaccurate and deleted from 
the database (especially for old museum records). 
- 27 - 
Only species recorded from 8 unique pixels or more (at the resolution of 
2.5  arc  minutes;  see  below)  were  processed  further  with  species  distribution 
models to avoid high  over-fitting  as  a result  of using  a very small number  of 
species  occurrences  with  Maxent  (Baldwin  2009).  Twenty-eight  terrestrial 
reptile species were excluded from this study on this basis (see Appendix 2). 
More records for these species are required in order to be able to assess their 
potential response to climate change, particularly urgent since many are either 
endemics/near-endemics  or  with  restricted  ranges.  This  results  in  having  a 
final  database  of  12,188  records  representing  75  species  (49  lizards,  25 
snakes, and 1 tortoise - the species list and number of valid records for each 
are given in Table 5). The collection dates of the records were found to range 
from 1821 to 2011, with an apparent increase in the recording effort from 1950 
onwards  (Fig.  6).  The  coverage  of  the  records  is  good,  covering  most  of 
Egypt’s landscape and habitats (Fig. 7a). Bias in recording effort (represented 
by the number of valid records) was checked across a 0.25º grid, showing high 
bias towards the main cities and populated areas (Fig. 7b). Unsurprisingly, the 
highest collection  effort  was found  around the  greater Cairo district, followed 
by  South  Sinai  (the  St  Katherine  area),  the  Alexandria  area,  some  areas 
around  Fayoum  and  Wadi  El-Natrun  and  small  patches  near  El-Arish  and 
Mersa Matruh. 
 
Environmental predictor variables  
Climate data for the  near past (1950-2000)  was downloaded from  WorldClim 
Global Climate Data v1.4 (release 3 - see: http://www.worldclim.org) (Hijmans 
et  al.  2005).  These  data  were  considered  to  indicate  the  current  climate 
conditions.  The  Worldclim  website  provides  a  set  of  global  environmental 
layers (at different resolutions) in the form of 19 climate variables (bio-layers: 
see  Table  6)  derived  from  precipitation  and  temperature  records.  Bio-layers 
were clipped to  the  boundaries  of  Egypt using Clip tool in ArcMap 10 (ESRI, 
USA). The resolution of 2.5 arc-minutes (~5 km square) was chosen to run the 
distribution  models  because  it  is  appropriate  to  the  level  of  uncertainty  that 
accompanies  the  museum  records  (which  form  the  majority  of  the  records), 
and because the climate data for Egypt were interpolated using relatively few 
weather stations  largely  concentrated  in  the  Nile Valley  and  Delta  (Newbold 
- 28 - 
2009 -  Fig.  8), creating more uncertainty. A special study  may  be  needed  to 
validate the reliability of bio-layers derived from relatively few weather stations 
in  species  distribution  modelling,  but  this  will  need  independent  field  data 
(Martínez-Meyer 2005). A further benefit of running the models at a resolution 
of 2.5 arc-minutes instead of the more detailed 30 arc-seconds is not only that 
this reduces run times and storage space, but it also is thought to minimise the 
effect of ignoring species interactions on modelled distributions, which can not 
be managed in correlative models: Pearson &amp; Dawson (2003) argued that the 
impact  of  biological  interactions  on  distribution  models  is  minimized  by 
constructing  models  at  macro-scales,  where  the  influence  of  environmental 
variables on species distributions dominate. 
Elevation  data  were  obtained  from  the  SRTM  Digital  Elevation 
Database  v4.1  [available  at:  http://www.cgiar-csi.org/data/elevation],  which  is 
available  in  tiles  covering  the  globe.  The  tiles  that  cover  Egypt  were 
downloaded  at  90-m  resolution,  merged  together  using  the  Mosaic  tool, 
clipped to the boundaries of Egypt, and rescaled to be of the same resolution 
of other layers (2.5 arc minutes) using ArcMap 10 (ESRI, USA). 
  An  Egyptian  geological  habitat  map  was  one  of  the  products  of  the 
BioMAP project (A. A. Hassan, unpublished data), and was used here. In this 
map, the habitat of Egypt is classified into 11 classes (sea, littoral coastal land, 
cultivated  land,  sand  dune,  wadi,  metamorphic  rock,  igneous  rock,  gravels, 
serir sand sheets, sabkhas  and sedimentary rocks) based  on  existing  maps, 
remote  sensing  and  extensive  ground-truthing  (Newbold  et  al.  2009a).  The 
layer was available in vector format, and was converted to ascii raster format 
at the same resolution of other variables (2.5 arc minutes). 
  The normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a remote-sensing 
product  indicating  the  greenness  of  vegetation;  it  is  used  to  monitor  the 
vegetation condition of the landscape, and to discriminate between vegetation 
and non-vegetation  areas. It has therefore  often  been used as  a correlate of 
faunal  species  occurrence  and  diversity  in  species  distribution  modelling 
(Leyequien  et  al.  2007;  Peterson  et  al.  2011),  including  studies  of  reptiles 
(Rashid 2007; Costa et al. 2010; Taheri 2010; de Pous et al. 2011; Wooten &amp; 
Gibbs 2012). In this study, NDVI data for seven years (from Jan 2004 to Dec 
2010)  were  downloaded  from  the  SPOT  Vegetation  website  (see: 
- 29 - 
http://free.vgt.vito.be/).  They  are  provided  as  10-day  synthetic  maps  at  a 
resolution  of 1 km,  and  a total  of 252 maps were  obtained representing data 
from  2004  to  2010.  The  maximum  and  minimum  value  of  each  pixel  was 
calculated across the full set of maps. Two layers were derived from and used 
as  predictors  in  the  models:  maximum  NDVI  value  (indicating  how  much 
vegetation  there  is  per  pixel),  and  the  difference  between  maximum  and 
minimum  NDVI  value  (indicating  the  degree  of  fluctuation  in  vegetation  per 
pixel).  The  layers  were  clipped  to  the  boundaries  of  Egypt,  and  re-scaled  to 
2.5 arc-minutes resolution. 
  In  order  to  reduce  the  negative  effect  of  having  high  correlations 
between  predictor  variables  on  model  performance  and  the  over-fitting 
resulting  from  using  many  variables,  the  Variance  Inflation  Factor  (VIF) 
statistic  was  calculated  among  the  continuous  variables  as  a  measure  of 
multicollinearity. The VIF statistic has  been widely  used (with other statistical 
alternatives)  as  a  measure  of  collinearity  between  continuous  variables  in 
order to  prune  predictors before use (Farren  et al. 2010; Fernández-Moya  et 
al. 2010; Bombi &amp; D’Amen 2011; Bombi et al. 2012).  
Four  bio-layers  were  excluded  prior  to  VIF  calculations  because  they 
show only minor variability in their values across Egypt (see Fig. 9) and hence 
do not provide valuable information to the models. The excluded layers were: 
Bio7 (temperature  annual range), Bio14 (precipitation  of driest month), Bio17 
(precipitation of driest quarter), and Bio18 (precipitation of warmest quarter). In 
variable  Bio14,  for  example,  almost  all  pixels  were  shown  to  have  0  value 
except just 5 pixels that have a value of 1 (as shown in Fig. 9). This explicitly 
reflects  how  arid  Egypt  is.  Using  these  variables  will  not  provide  useful 
information to the models and may just add extra noise, so they were excluded 
before calculating the VIF statistic.

All the rest of the continuous variables (altitude, NDVI maximum value, 
difference between NDVI maximum and minimum values, and 15 bio-layers – 
see: Table 7) were involved in the collinearity test. VIF calculations were done 
using R software v2.15 (&#39;car&#39; package - R Development Core Team 2012); the 
variable  with  the  highest  VIF  score  was  removed  first  and  new  VIF  values 
calculated  between  the  remaining  variables,  a  process  repeated  until  all 
yielded VIF values below 10. The resulting variables (the grey shaded rows in 
Table 7) were then used in the Maxent modelling.

To estimate the potential impact of climate change on Egypt biodiversity 
(represented here by reptiles), current distribution models were projected into 
the future. This was done for three time slices (2020, 2050, and 2080). Future 
climate data (IPCC 4th assessment data - IPCC 2007) were downloaded from 
the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture website (see http://www.ccafs-
climate.org/). In this study, four Global Circulation Models (GCMs) were used 
at each time slice to minimise the effect of model type and model calculation 
method  on  the  final  results,  giving  an  average  overall  trend  of  the  potential 
impacts  of  climate change  (i.e.  some  elements  of  ensemble  modelling).  The 
four  GCMs  used  were  the  Hadley  Centre  Coupled  Model,  version  3 
(HadCM3),  produced  by  the  Hadley  Centre  for  Climate  Prediction  and 
Research (UK), the second-generation coupled global climate model produced 
by  the  Canadian  Centre  for  Climate  Modelling  and  Analysis  (CGCM2-
- 38 - 
CCCma),  a  model  produced  by  the  Commonwealth  Scientific  and  Industrial 
Research Organization  in  Australia (CSIRO  Mk2)  and  a model  produced  by 
the  Japanese  Centre  for  Climate  System  Research  (NIES99).  These  GCMs 
have  been  frequently  used  in  species  distribution  modelling  studies  that 
involve climate change impacts on biodiversity (Araújo et al. 2006; Mika et al. 
2008; Holt et al. 2009; Rödder 2009; Rödder &amp; Weinsheimer 2009; Buisson et 
al.  2010; Fouquet et al. 2010; Brito  et  al.  2011; Hu &amp; Jiang  2011;  Nori  et al. 
2011;  Sanchez  et  al.  2011;  Wilms  et  al.  2011).  In  this  study,  possible 
evolutionary  and/or  phenological  responses  to  climate  change  were  not 
considered,  so  I  assume  that  species  will  try  to  track  their  suitable  habitat 
(depending  on  dispersal  ability)  rather  than  accommodate  to  the  new 
conditions.  The  fossil  record  shows  little  evidence  of  species  evolutionary 
response  to  past  climate  changes;  during  the  Pleistocene  glaciation,  for 
example,  the  fauna  and  flora  were  subjected  to  climate  change  5-10  times 
stronger than that of the 20
th
 century, and the main response was to track the 
changed climate (Maiorano et al. 2011).  
For each GCM model and time slice, two emission scenarios (A2a and 
B2a) were used, derived from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC)  Special  Report:  these  are  the  most  commonly  used  scenarios  in 
climate-change  assessments  (Hannah  2011).  They  reflect  two  different 
assumptions  about  the  levels  of  CO 2   emissions,  linked  to  assumed 
demographic  changes  and  socio-economic  and  technological  developments 
(Marini et al. 2009). In the A2a scenario, it is assumed that CO 2  emission rate 
will  be  unrestrictedly  doubled  by  2050  (medium  to  high  emission  rates  - 
&#34;Business  as  usual&#34;  scenario)  due  to  a  highly  heterogeneous  future  world 
characterized  by  high  population  growth  rate,  increased  land-use  changes, 
and  not  much  technological  improvement;  while  in  the  B2a  scenario,  it  is 
assumed that CO 2  emission rates will remain unchanged or even decrease by 
2050  (medium  to  low  emission  rates  -  &#34;moderate&#34;  scenario)  due  to  an 
environmentally  conscious  future  world  characterized  by  slower  population 
growth rate and land-use changes, and more technological innovations (Sauer 
et al. 2011; Saupe et al. 2011; Taubmann et al. 2011). Sets of future climate 
layers  equivalent  to  those  used  in  the  current-distribution  models  were 
prepared  to  be  used  in  future  projections.  We  have  no  idea  how  NDVI  and 
- 39 - 
habitat variables will alter in the future, and so I assumed in the future models 
that these variables will not alter; a further predictor variable will also not alter, 
altitude. 
 
Species distribution modelling 
In this study, Maxent software v3.3.3k (Phillips et al. 2004; Phillips et al. 2006 -  
see:  http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/)  was  chosen  to  run  the 
models, for reasons explained above. Ten replicated runs with cross-validation 
were made for each species (except species distributed in less than 10 unique 
pixels  &#39;at  the  resolution  of  2.5  arc  minutes&#39;:  in  these  cases  the  number  of 
replicates  was  set  automatically  to  the  number  of  unique  points).  This  was 
done by randomly  dividing the records into  10% sections,  and then each run 
used 90% of the data (training), leaving 10% for testing. This was repeated ten 
times, each with a different 10% of the data for testing. This method gets the 
best use of all the data for validation, especially if there are not many records 
(Phillips  &amp;  AT&amp;T  Research  2011).  This  also  obtains  a  more  stable  model 
performance to estimate the potential distribution, and minimises the effect of 
possible errors and bias in species records.  The habitat map (categorical) and 
all  non-collinear  continuous  variables  (grey-shaded  rows  in  Table  7)  were 
used to  run  the  models.  The  mean  (±  SD)  AUC  values  of  the  ten  replicated 
runs are given in Table 9. 
Default  Maxent  settings  have  been  shown  to  have  the  potential  of 
achieving a performance as good as if they were tuned on the evaluation data 
itself  (Phillips  &amp;  Dudik  2008).  Default  settings  were  used  to run the models, 
with just one exception: the maximum number of iterations was set to 1000, to 
be  sure  of  allowing  the  algorithm  enough  time  to  converge  (Phillips  et  al. 
2006).  The  logistic  output  format  was  chosen,  i.e.  the  probability  of 
occurrence,  ranging  from  0  to  1.  From  the  cross-validation  runs,  ten  raster 
ASCII  files  were  produced  for  each  species,  together  with  the  overall  mean 
probability  distribution.  For  each  species,  the  most  influential  variable  was 
determined  as  the  variable  with  the  highest  mean  permutation  importance 
across  model  runs.  Mean  contribution  value  of  each  variable  across  all 
- 40 - 
species was also calculated to indicate the most influential variable across all 
Egyptian reptile species. 
In order to convert the Maxent probabilities of occurrence into predicted 
presence/absence (or, more precisely, suitable/non-suitable habitat), the form 
required  for  further  analyses,  the  10
th
-percentile  training  presence  threshold 
was  used  (following:  Pearson  et  al.  2007).  This  threshold  is  determined  by 
assuming  that  10%  of  the  training  points  which  have  the  lowest  predicted 
values  were  not  precisely  located,  either  because  they  were  erroneously 
georeferenced, are migrants, or are ephemeral populations (Morueta-Holme et 
al.  2010).  A  pixel  is  assigned  to  indicate  presence  (suitable)  if  it  has  a 
predicted  value  more than the lowest 10%  of the predicted  values  of training 
records. For each species, ten thresholded distribution maps were created by 
Maxent from the ten probability maps. Maxent does not automatically provide 
an  overall  presence/absence  map  for  each  species,  so  this  was  created 
manually  by  assigning presence  to  a  pixel  if  it  has  presence  values  in  more 
than  half  of  the  model  runs  (&gt;5  runs).  This  was  done  using  the  Raster 
Calculator tool in ArcMap 10 (ESRI, USA). 
  The  current  predicted  distributions  (750  model  runs  for  75  species) 
were then projected into the future to assess the potential impacts of climate 
change on Egyptian reptiles. This was done for three future time slices (2020, 
2050, and 2080), four GCM models (HadCM3, CCCma, CSIRO, and NIES99) 
and two emission scenarios (A2a and A2b); giving a total of 24 possible future 
projections. The average impact of different GCMs was calculated to see the 
overall  effect  of  climate  change  on  Egyptian  reptiles,  regardless  of  which 
model  was  used.  This  gave  a  total  of  six  mean  future  analysis  sets  (3 time 
slices X 2 emission scenarios). 
For each species, each current predicted distribution run was projected 
into the  future using  24  possible  future  projections;  this  produces  240  future 
projections  for  each  species  (10  replicated  runs  for  each  species  were 
projected into 24 possible future projections), overall 18,000 future projections 
for the 75 species. For each future projection, two map sets were created: the 
potential  future  probability  and  thresholded  (suitable/non-suitable) 
distributions. 
- 41 - 
As  for  current  predictions,  the means  of  ten  projected  replicated  runs 
was  calculated,  producing  24  possible  future  distributions  for  each  species. 
Thresholded  future  distributions  made  by  Maxent  were  based  on  the 
assumption  that  species  have  the  ability  to disperse freely to  newly  suitable 
areas, considered unrealistic for at least some species (Peterson et al. 2002). 
Giving  that information  on the  dispersal  ability of most reptile species is  very 
limited (Cadby et al. 2010; Edgar et al. 2010), two extreme assumptions were 
used in the analyses: unlimited dispersal and no-dispersal, to allow a full range 
of possible outcomes - both assumptions are commonly used in the literature. 
The  true  response  should  lie  somewhere  in  between,  depending  on  the 
species’ ability to track future climate change (Maiorano et al. 2011), although 
using  both  assumptions  and  ignoring  the  effect  of  biotic  interactions  on 
distributions  has been criticized (Araújo  &amp; Peterson 2012). For the ‘unlimited 
dispersal’  assumption,  species  were  assumed  to  have  the  ability  to  move  to 
newly  suitable  habitats  without  restriction  or  giving  attention  to  any  barriers. 
For the ‘no dispersal’  assumption, species  were  assumed to be incapable  of 
moving  to  newly  suitable  areas:  if  the  current  occupied  area  became 
unsuitable  in the  future,  the  species  was  assumed  to  become  extinct  in  that 
area.  No  account  was  taken  of  any  interactions  among  species,  such  as 
competition  and  predation  (Peterson  et  al.  2002),  because  there  is  no 
information about any such interactions to guide the modelling. 
The average future thresholded distributions of replicated runs were not 
created  automatically  by  Maxent;  they  were  calculated  using  the  Raster 
Calculator and Reclassify tools in ArcMap 10 (ESRI, USA). For the unlimited-
dispersal assumption, future thresholded distribution maps were used directly 
to  calculate  the  average  future  thresholded  distributions;  each  pixel  was 
assigned as a presence (suitable) if it was predicted to be potentially suitable 
in more than half of the replicated runs (&gt;5); this resulted in having 24 potential 
future  thresholded  distribution  maps  for  each  species.  For  the  no-dispersal 
assumption, the resulting thresholded distribution maps were not directly used, 
but  were processed  first  using  ArcMap 10 (ESRI,  USA)  in  such  a  way  as  to 
assign a pixel to be a presence if it had presence value in both the current and 
future  projection.  The  mean  overall  thresholded  distributions  for  no-dispersal 
replicated runs were calculated as in the case of unlimited dispersal.  
- 42 - 
The mean future predictions of the four GCMs were calculated as well; 
this was done for both probability and thresholded distributions. For probability 
distributions,  a  mean  of  the  four  global  circulation  models  was  calculated, 
yielding  just  six  mean  future  probability  maps  (3  time  slices  X  2  emission 
scenarios).  Thresholded  distributions  were  done  using  both  dispersal 
assumptions: a pixel was assigned to be potentially suitable if it had a value of 
presence  in  more  than  two  GCMs,  this  gave  six  overall  thresholded  future 
projections per species (for each of unlimited and no dispersal assumptions). 
 
Comparisons across species 
Current  and  future  predicted  species  richness  maps  were  calculated  in  two 
different  ways:  first,  by  simply  adding  together  the  average  probability 
distribution  maps  of  all  species  (assuming  future  unlimited  dispersal);  and 
second, by adding together the thresholded distribution maps (assuming future 
unlimited-  and  no-dispersal  assumptions).  For  current  species  richness,  two 
maps were created using either probability or thresholded distributions. Future 
species  richness  maps  were  calculated  for  each  of  the  24  possible  future 
projections,  using  either  probability  (unlimited  dispersal)  or  thresholded 
(unlimited and no dispersal) distributions. The overall means of future species 
richness  maps  across  the  four  GCMs  were  also  calculated  using  either 
probability  (unlimited  dispersal)  or  thresholded  (unlimited  and  no-dispersal) 
distributions. 
  Future  potential  changes  in  species  richness  were  also  calculated  by 
subtracting current species-richness from future species-richness maps. This 
does  not  take  into  consideration  the  potential  future  changes  in  species 
composition,  but  just  gives  an  indication  of  which  areas  will  have  an  altered 
(increased  or  decreased)  numbers  of  species.  This  resulted  in  having  24 
species  richness  changes  maps  either  using  either  probability  distributions 
(unlimited  dispersal)  or  thresholded  distributions  (either  unlimited  or  no-
dispersal). I calculated the average future changes in species richness across 
the four GCMs. 
  Gains  and  losses  in future species  distributions  were calculated using 
current  and  future  thresholded  distributions.  The  current  thresholded 
- 43 - 
distribution  of  each  species  was  reclassified  (using  the  Reclassify  tool  in 
ArcMap 10),  giving  a  value  of  3 to  presence  pixels  and  0 to  absence  pixels. 
For each species, values of every possible future thresholded distribution were 
added. In the resulting map, a pixel with a value of 4 indicated that this pixel 
was  maintained  suitable  in  the  future;  0  indicated  that  this  pixel  was 
maintained unsuitable in the future; 3 indicated that the pixel lost its suitability 
for the species in this  area (unlimited  and no dispersal);  and 1 indicated that 
the pixel gained suitability for this species (unlimited dispersal) (Fig. 10). Gains 
and losses for  each species  were exported separately to new GIS  files. The 
losses  across  all the  24 future  potential distributions  across  all species  were 
added together into a species loss map showing which areas are predicted to 
suffer  most  in  losing  species  (unlimited  and  no-dispersal).  The  data  can  be 
expressed as a percentage of the species richness of a pixel. The same was 
carried out performed for gains in suitability to produce a species gain map to 
showing which areas are predicted to gain much species (unlimited dispersal), 
which can be interpretable as potential refugee for the reptile species. A mean 
value  across  GCMs  of  total  lost  or  gained  suitability  maps  were  also 
calculated.

Fig. 10:  Calculation of future species gain or lost areas 
 
 
Species  turnover,  an  index  of  dissimilarity  between current  and future 
species  composition  (Thuiller  2004)  was  calculated.  It  is  defined  as  the  net 
- 44 - 
change  in  the  number  of  species  in  a  particular  area  (Broennimann  et  al. 
2006).  Species  turnover  is  often  considered  a  good  measure  of  community 
composition  change,  ecosystem  disturbance  and  the  potential  impacts  of 
climate  change  from  regional  to  continental  scales  (Thuiller  2004; 
Broennimann  et  al.  2006).  Areas  with  small  turnover  values  (close  to  0) 
indicate  that  the  species  assemblage  at  these  areas  is  predicted  to  remain 
unchanged  in  the  future  (no  species  loss  or  gain);  while  areas  with  a  high 
turnover values (close to  100) indicate that the species  assemblage  at these 
areas  is  predicted  to  be  completely  different  in  the  future  (i.e.  all  species 
occupying  the  area  are  predicted  to  be  lost/replaced  in  the  future)  (Thuiller 
2004;  Broennimann  et  al.  2006).  For  each  future  projection,  and  assuming 
both dispersal assumptions, species turnover was calculated as the following 
(following: Peterson et al. 2002; Thuiller et al. 2005; Broennimann et al. 2006): 
                 (unlimited dispersal) = 100 ∗  
   +   
   +   
 
   
                 (no dispersal) = 100 ∗ 
  
  
 
 
Where  SL  is  the  number  of  potentially  lost  species,  SG  is  the  number  of 
potentially gained species, and SR is the current species richness. 
 
In  order  to  assess  the  future  extinction  risk  of  Egyptian  reptiles  as  a 
result  of  climate  change,  and  to determine  which species  may  require more 
protection  in  the  future,  species  range  changes  were  calculated:  the 
percentage  loss  (or  gain)  in  suitable  habitats  (unlimited-  and  no-dispersal 
assumptions). This  was calculated by counting the number of suitable pixels 
for  each  species  in  current  and  future  maps,  and  calculating  the  average 
percentage  of loss (or gain) in the number of pixels. Each species was then 
classified  into  one  of  the following categories  (at  each  of  24  possible  future 
projections and a mean classification among different GCMs): Extinct (loss of 
the  entire  suitable  habitat  -  100%),  Critically  Endangered  (loss  &gt;80%), 
Endangered  (loss  50-80%),  Vulnerable  (loss  30-50%),  Least  Concern  (loss 
&lt;30%), gain 1 (gain &lt;30%), gain 2 (gain 30-50%), gain 3 (gain 50-80%), gain 
- 45 - 
4 (gain 80-100%),  and gain 5 (gain &gt;100) (Modified from: Thuiller et al. 2005; 
Levinsky et al. 2007; Fitzpatrick et al. 2008). 
  Egyptian  reptile  species  were  classified  according  to  their  world 
distribution to reflect Egypt’s responsibility on their conservation; this was done 
following  (Gilbert  &amp;  Zalat  2008).  The  different  classes  are:  widespread  (the 
species  exists  in  more  than  one  continent  and  more  than  one  ecological 
habitat);  narrow  (the  species  exists  in  six  or  more  countries  in  a  consistent 
band);  restricted  (the  species  exists  in  only  3-5 nearly  connected  countries); 
near-endemic (the species  exists  only  in Egypt  and  a  maximum of  other two 
adjacent  countries);  and  endemic  (the  species  is  only recorded from  Egypt). 
Species  world  distribution  was  roughly  determined  using  online  databases 
(e.g.  www.iucnredlist.org,  www.catalogueoflife.org,  and  www.reptile-
database.org) and also (Baha El Din 2006a). 
Distribution patterns  within Egypt  were determined following (Gilbert &amp; 
Zalat  2008). This was done based  on  the number  of  eco-regions from  which 
each species has been recorded. Egypt’s eco-regions were defined by (Boulos 
1999-2006),  who  divided  the  country  into  eight  eco-regions:  Nile  Valley, 
Oases, Mediterranean strip, Eastern Desert, Western Desert, Red Sea coast, 
Gebel  Elba,  and  Sinai.  Species  were  classified  into  three  categories: 
widespread (recorded from four  or more  eco-regions), narrow (recorded from 
two or  three  eco-regions)  and localized (recorded from  only  one  eco-region). 
The  number  of  eco-regions  occupied  by  each species  was  determined using 
visual interpretations of species distributions across the different eco-regions. 
Neither the global nor national distribution classification is a fixed measure, but 
depends on visual interpretation and personal opinion. 
  The analyses weighted species using their Red List conservation status 
in  Egypt  according  to  IUCN  guideline  and  categories  (IUCN  Standards  and 
Petitions  Subcommittee  2010).  Incomplete  IUCN  assessments  were 
performed using only information derived from distribution records. As required 
by  IUCN,  these  classifications  involve  the  calculation  of  various  measures: 
AOO  (Area  of  Occupancy),  EOO  (Extent  of  Occurrence),  and  number  of 
‘locations’. AOO is defined as “the area within EOO, which is occupied by the 
species, excluding cases of vagrancy”. A grid size of 4.2 km
2
 was used in the 
calculation  of  AOO  (Annabelle  Cuttleod,  pers.  comm.;  following:  Gilbert  &amp; 
- 46 - 
Zalat 2008; Basuony et al. 2010). This was calculated by counting the number 
of grid cells occupied by the species and multiplying by the area of each grid 
cell.  EOO  is  defined  as  “the  area  contained  within  the  shortest  continuous 
imaginary boundary which can be drawn to encompass all the known, inferred 
or  projected  sites  of  present  occurrence  of  a  taxon,  excluding  cases  of 
vagrancy”  (IUCN  Standards  and  Petitions  Subcommittee  2010).  EOO  is 
measured by calculating the area of the minimum convex polygon containing 
the  records,  i.e.  the  smallest  polygon  containing  all  the  records  that  has  no 
internal  angle  exceeding  180°:  this  was  calculated  using  GME  software 
(Geospatial  Modelling  Environment  v0.6  –  see: 
http://www.spatialecology.com/gme/). Any decline in AOO, EOO or number of 
locations  (before  and  after  1950)  were  noted.  The  National  Red  Data  List 
presented in this study should not be considered as the definitive view of the 
current  status  of  Egyptian  reptiles,  but  just  gives  a  rough  indication  of  their 
threat status. A detailed and accurate assessment is needed; a clear example 
is  the  status  of  the  Egyptian  tortoise,  Testudo  kleinmanni.  It  is  classified 
globally as Critically Endangered with very limited current distribution in Egypt, 
but in this study, it is classified as Vulnerable based on information on its very 
limited  distribution  (see  below).  The  global  IUCN  assessment  of  Egyptian 
species was obtained from the IUCN Red List website (IUCN Version 2012.1 - 
see: http://www.iucnredlist.org/). 
 
Area prioritization for conservation 
Recently,  several  algorithms  have  been  available  to  prioritize  areas  for 
conservation  and conservation planning; these include Zonation (Moilanen  et 
al. 2005; Moilanen 2007;  Moilanen et  al. 2012), Marxan (Game  &amp;  Grantham 
2008;  Watts  et  al.  2009),  ConsNet  (Ciarleglio  et  al.  2008;  Ciarleglio  et  al. 
2009),  MultCSync  (Moffett  et  al.  2005),  WorldMap  (Williams  2001),  and 
ResNet (Sarkar et al. 2002). Using the predictions from the species distribution 
models, Zonation v3.1 (Moilanen et al. 2012) was used in this study to create 
a nested  spatial  conservation  prioritization  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  and 
performance of current Protected Area network in Egypt and to prioritize other 
sites for conservation (i.e. potential areas to expand the current PA network).  
- 47 - 
Zonation  is  a  framework  for  conservation  prioritization  and  spatial 
conservation  planning  (Moilanen  et  al.  2012).  It  is  based  on  hierarchically 
prioritizing the conservation value of the landscape based on the conservation 
value  of  sites  (cells)  (Moilanen  2007;  Moilanen  et  al.  2012).  The  software 
starts with the full extent of the landscape, and then generates rankings of the 
cells  by  iteratively  removing  the  least  valuable  cells  from  the  edges  of  the 
landscape  according  to  set  rules  (e.g.  minimizing  marginal  loss  of  the 
conservation  value and maintaining high  habitat connectivity). The last  to be 
removed  are the  most important  areas (Moilanen et al. 2005;  Moilanen et al. 
2012).  The  order  of  the  cell  removal  is  recorded  and  can  be  used  later  to 
select  any  given  top  or bottom  percentage  of  the  landscape (e.g.  highest  or 
lowest 10%) (Moilanen 2007). In Zonation, there are four different cell-removal 
rule  sets  that  specify  how  conservation  value is  aggregated  across  features 
and  space,  determining  which  cell  leads  to  smallest  marginal  loss  of 
biodiversity value: Basic core-area Zonation, Additive benefit function, Target-
based planning, and Generalized benefit function (Moilanen et al. 2012). Two 
of  these  were  used  in  this  study  (Basic  core-area  Zonation  and  Additive 
benefit function).  
Basic  core-area  Zonation  was  used  to  identify  important  (or  poor) 
locations  where  a single  or  a few species have important  occurrences,  while 
Additive  benefit function was used to give  more  weight to  locations with high 
species  richness  (Moilanen  et  al.  2012).  The  resulting  maps  of  conservation 
importance do not agree completely, which means that there can be species-
poor  areas  with  some  rare  species.  The  manual  suggests  running  Zonation 
with  both  removal  options  and  comparing  the  results,  since  this  may  reveal 
some  interesting  information  (Moilanen  et  al.  2012).  In the  calculations  each 
species  is  given  a  weight,  allowing  some  species  to  be  more  important  to 
conserve than others. Unequal weights were assigned to all the reptile species 
using  the  Global  IUCN  assessment,  species  world  distribution,  distribution 
patterns  within  Egypt,  and  national  IUCN  species  classification.  For  each 
element, a score was given (Table 8) to indicate relative importance, and then 
the sum of the scores  gave the relative conservation  weight  of  each species 
(Table 9).

It is undesirable to have a highly fragmented network of reserves, and 
therefore there is a balance to be struck between protecting all the best areas, 
and maintaining large reserves with good connectivity. This is accomplished in 
Zonation  by  the  ‘aggregation  rule’.  I  used  Distribution  Smoothing  as  the 
aggregation rule,  which  estimates the way  each species  uses the  landscape 
and the spatial scale of dispersal, represented by an α-value for each species. 
The α-value indicates how species use the surrounding landscape and can be 
calculated  based  on  the  dispersal  capability  or  the  home  range sizes  of  the 
species (Moilanen et al. 2012). I calculated it as the following: 
  = 
2
[                  ]
 
 
Dispersal  distance  needs  to  be  in  the  same  units  as  the  predicted 
distribution  maps  (degrees  in  this  study);  so  the  α-value  was  adjusted  by 
converting the measurement units from km to degrees using the resolution of 
the maps (2.5 arc-minutes, 0.0416°, about 4.6388 km). 
  =  
2 ∗ [4.6388]
[                   (     )] ∗ [0.0416]
 
 
The  dispersal  ability  of  almost  all  terrestrial  reptile  species  is  very 
limited  (Cadby  et  al.  2010;  Edgar  et  al.  2010),  which  makes  them  more 
vulnerable to rapid  environmental  changes  (Araujo &amp;  Pearson  2005). In this 
study,  the  dispersal  distance  of  all  reptiles  was  set  to  be  equal  to  1  km, 
entailing one α-value for all species (=223). 
Zonation was run using the maps of occurrence probabilities for all the 
species using both Basic core-area Zonation and Additive benefit function cell 
removal rules. The number of cells removed at each iteration was set to 10 (= 
- 49 - 
‘warp factor’). Both the  current  and  mean probability  distributions  of  different 
future GCMs were used. Zonation results were produced in the form of ASCII 
raster files,  with  values ranging from 0 to 1. Areas  with Zonation rank  values 
&gt;0.7 were considered to be of high conservation importance. These important 
areas were then overlaid with the current Protected Area system in Egypt (Fig. 
5) to show if the network in Egypt is adequate to conserve the species in the 
face  of  climate  change,  and  if  there  are  areas  outside  the  current  PA 
boundaries that require special protection measures.

Results 
 
Model performance 
The performance of current distribution models, in terms of mean AUC values, 
was  good.  The  mean  AUC  value  of  10  repeat  model  runs  for  each  species 
ranged from 0.78 to 0.99 with an overall mean of 0.93 ± 0.05. The lowest and 
highest  mean  AUC  values  were for  Ptyodactylus  siphonorhina  (0.78 ±  0.09) 
and Mesalina pasteuri (0.99 ± 0.01), respectively (Fig. 11). Only one species 
(Ptyodactylus siphonorhina) had a mean AUC of less than 0.8; there were five 
species between 0.8 and 0.85, 14 species between 0.85 and 0.9, 19 species 
between  0.9  and  0.95  and  36  species  with  mean  AUC  values  greater  than 
0.95  (Fig.  12).  AUC  variability  among  replicate  runs  was  low,  with  standard 
deviations of less than 0.1 in 67 species, between 0.1 and 0.2 in six species, 
and  between  0.2  and  0.3  in  two  species  (Naja  nubiae  and  Hemidactylus 
robustus)  (Table  9).  Mean  AUC  values  for  highly  weighted  species  (weight 
value ≥ 12) range from 0.887 and 0.993, with a mean of 0.97 ± 0.03. As almost 
all  species  have  a  mean  AUC  value  &gt;  0.8,  all  models  were  accepted  and 
processed for further analyses (see Table 9 for a list of mean AUC value, s.d., 
and the weighting value of each species). 
A  highly  significant  strong  negative  correlation  was  found  between 
mean AUC values and both of the predicted area occupied by the species (in 
terms  of  the  number  of  currently  predicted  suitable  pixels;  n=75,  r s =  -  0.85, 
p&lt;0.005 – Fig. 13) and species current extent of occurrence (EOO - calculated 
as the  minimum convex polygon containing species distribution points; n=75, 
r s =  -  0.77,  p&lt;0.005  –  Fig.  14);  and  a  significant  weak  negative  correlation 
between mean AUC values and the number of species unique recorded points 
used to run the models (n=75, r s = - 0.433, p&lt;0.005 – Fig. 15).  
 
Most influential environmental variables 
Variables  with  highest  mean  permutation  importance  across  all  modelled 
species,  and  hence  potentially  the  highest  contribution  to final models,  were 
altitude,  Bio4  (temperature  seasonality)  and  Bio13  (precipitation  of  wettest 
- 51 - 
month).  Those  with  the  lowest  mean  permutation  importance,  and  thus  not 
influencing the final models very much, were the difference between maximum 
and minimum NDVI, Bio15 (precipitation seasonality), habitat and Bio9 (mean 
temperature  of  driest  quarter)  (Fig.  16).  The  most  influential  environmental 
variable across species was altitude (highest for 34 species), followed by Bio4 
(temperature  seasonality  –  10  species)  and  Bio13  (precipitation  of  wettest 
month  –  9  species)  (Fig.  17).  Two  environmental  variables  were  never  the 
most influential variable for any species: the difference between maximum and 
minimum NDVI and Bio9 (mean temperature of driest quarter). 
 
Species richness 
Current species richness 
Using  probability  distributions,  the  areas  with  the  highest  current  species 
richness are located at the greater Cairo area, the Suez Canal area extending 
from Suez to Port-Said, around Damietta and Alexandria and scattered small 
patches on Suez and Aqaba gulfs in Sinai and the Eastern Desert; other such 
areas  are  Wadi  El-Natrun,  Fayoum  and  scattered  locations  on  the 
Mediterranean coast (Fig. 18). Using thresholded distributions, the areas with 
the  highest  species  richness  are  the  Suez  Canal  area,  the  greater  Cairo 
southwards towards Fayoum and Beni Suef and eastwards towards Suez and 
Ismailia, the northern coast of the Nile Delta from Damietta to Rashid, Wadi El-
Natrun, around Alexandria, coastal areas of the Suez and Aqaba Gulfs in Sinai 
and the Eastern Desert, and the north coast and coastal areas in North Sinai 
(Fig. 20). 
 
Future species richness changes 
Using  probability  distributions,  under  the  A2a  scenario  it  is  predicted  that 
species richness  will increase  by  2020 in coastal  areas between Safaga  and 
El-Quseir, Bir Abraq area, patchy areas on the north coast from Alexandria to 
west of Mersa Matruh, both sides of the Suez Canal near El-Salam lake, east 
of Fayoum in the Nile valley, near Ras Mohamed in South Sinai and scattered 
areas  from  east  and  central  Sinai  northwards  towards  the  Mediterranean 
- 52 - 
coast. Species richness is predicted to decline around the Siwa oasis, inland 
wadis  between  El-Quseir  and  Mersa Alam,  and  small  patches  south  of  Abu 
Zneima in the Suez gulf (Figs. 18, 19). By 2050, species richness is predicted 
to increase on the northern coast from west Alexandria to Sidi Barrani across 
the  northern  edge  of  the  Qattara  Depression,  in  the  Nile  Valley  (around  El-
Minia  and  Fayoum,  and  from  Sohag  to  Edfu),  Red  Sea  coastal  areas  from 
Mersa  Alam  to  north  of  Hurghada, Western  Desert  oases  (Kharga,  Dakhla, 
and Farafra),  South Sinai  (around Ras  Mohamed),  and  an  area from central 
Sinai northwards to the Gebel El-Hallal area. It is predicted to decline in small 
areas around Gebel Elba, southwest of El-Quseir, Siwa oasis, Wadi El-Natrun, 
the greater Cairo, north of Suez and west of Ismailia (Figs. 18, 19). By 2080, 
species  richness  is  predicted  to  increase  more  extensively  along  the  north 
Mediterranean  coast  as  far  south  as  the  northern  part  of  the  Qattara 
Depression, along the Red Sea coast from Mersa Alam to north of Hurghada, 
in the Nile Valley from Fayoum southwards, Western Desert oases, the Gebel 
El-Gallala  area,  on  both  sides  of  the  northern  parts  of  the  Suez  Canal,  the 
coasts of South Sinai and a major part of central Sinai northwards to the Gebel 
El-Hallal area. It is predicted to decline in small areas of Gebel Elba, Wadi El-
Natrun,  the  greater  Cairo  and  scattered  sites  along  the  Suez  Canal  near 
Ismailia (Figs. 18, 19). 
Under  the  B2a  scenario,  the  predicted  patterns  of  change  in  species 
richness do not differ much from those of the A2a scenario (see Figs. 18, 19). 
By 2020, species richness is predicted to increase  in Red Sea coastal areas 
near Berenice and El-Quseir and in small areas near El-Burullus Lake, with a 
greater area of increased species richness at the Mediterranean coast and in 
central to east Sinai. No increase is predicted at Bir Abraq and the Suez Canal 
area, and a greater decline in inland wadis near El-Quseir and at small coastal 
areas  of  the  Suez  and  Aqaba  gulfs  near Zaafarana  and  north  of  Dahab.  By 
2050, there is predicted to be less increase in species richness, compared to 
the A2a scenario, along the Red Sea coast from south of El-Quseir to north of 
Hurghada, in South Sinai, and in the Western Desert oases; greater increase 
in central to east Sinai and in inland wadis west of El-Quseir; and no decline at 
all in Siwa  and the Suez Canal area. By  2080, the  overall pattern  of species 
- 53 - 
richness increase is the same as for the A2a scenario, but the magnitudes and 
areas of increased species richness are lower. 
Using thresholded distributions there are two assumptions to consider, 
unlimited  dispersal  or  the  complete  absence  of  dispersal.  For  unlimited 
dispersal  under  the  A2a  scenario,  it  is  predicted  that  species  richness  will 
increase  by  2020  in  the  Bir  Abraq  area,  inland  areas  of  the  north  coast 
southwards  to  northern  parts  of  the  Qattara  Depression,  central  Sinai 
northwards to the Gebel El-Hallal area, west of Cairo, coastal areas between 
Safaga to south of El-Quseir, and on the western side of the lower Nile Valley 
(the Tushka area).  Declines are predicted in inland wadis from near Berenice 
northwards  to Gebel  El-Gallala,  the  area between  Suez,  Ismailia  and  Cairo, 
coastal  areas  on the Suez  and Aqaba gulfs in Sinai  and the Eastern Desert, 
the Gebel Elba area, Siwa oasis, and northwest of Wadi El-Natrun (Figs. 20, 
21).  By  2050,  species  richness  is  predicted  to  increase  in  the  Qattara 
Depression and inland areas of the north coast, the Abraq area, the Gebel El-
Gallala area, central Sinai northwards to the Gebel El-Hallal area, the northern 
part  of El-Qaa plain  on the eastern side of the  Suez Gulf in  Sinai,  the lower 
Nile  Valley  westwards  to  the  Tushka  area,  and  Western  Desert  oases. 
Declines  are  predicted  in  the  Suez  Canal  area,  greater  Cairo  eastwards 
towards Suez and Ismailia, Wadi El-Natrun northwards, coastal areas of both 
the  Suez  and  Aqaba  gulfs,  inland  wadis  near  the  Red  Sea  coast  between 
Berenice  and  north  of  Hurghada,  the  Gebel  Elba  area  and  scattered  areas 
near  the  North  Sinai  coast  (Figs.  20,  21).  By  2080,  species  richness  is 
predicted  to  increase  over  extensive  areas  covering  a  large  percentage  of 
Egypt,  including  more  than  half  of  the  Western  Desert  (the  Qattara 
Depression, Western Desert oases and Tushka), Gebel El-Gallala, Bir Abraq, 
coastal  areas  north  of  El-Quseir  and  an  area  extending  from  central  Sinai 
northwards  to Gebel  El-Hallal.  Declines  are predicted  in  the  Wadi  El-Natrun 
area,  greater  Cairo  eastwards  towards  Suez  and  Ismailia,  both  sides  of  the 
Suez  Canal,  the  Suez  and  Aqaba  Gulfs,  Gebel  Elba,  North  Sinai  north  of 
Gebel El-Hallal and inland wadis from Mersa Alam to Hurghada (Figs. 20, 21). 
  For  unlimited  dispersal  under  the B2a scenario,  the  overall  pattern  of 
predicted  changes  in  species  richness  does  not  differ  much  from  the  A2a 
scenario (Figs. 20, 21). By 2020, there is predicted to be less increase in the 
- 54 - 
Abraq  area  and  greater  declines  in  Wadi  El-Natrun  and  the  South  Sinai 
coasts.  By  2050,  there  will  be  less  decline  in  Wadi  El-Natrun  and  northern 
parts  of the Suez Canal,  and greater declines in the inland wadis  of the Red 
Sea  (west  of  Mersa  Alam  northwards)  and  on  South Sinai coasts.  By  2080, 
although the overall pattern of species richness increase does not differ from 
that  of  the  A2a  scenario,  the  magnitude  of  the  increase  is  greater  in  central 
and southern parts of the Western Desert, Gebel El-Gallala, the northern part 
of the Nile Delta and coastal areas of the Red Sea; and less in coastal areas 
of North Sinai. 
  Under the no-dispersal assumption and the A2a scenario, it is predicted 
that  species  richness  will  decline  by  2020  in  coastal  areas  of  the  Suez  and 
Aqaba gulfs, the Suez  Canal area, Wadi El-Natrun, the  area  between Cairo, 
Suez  and  Ismailia,  Siwa  oasis  and  the  Qattara  Depression,  Gebel  Elba, 
around  Berenice,  and  inland  wadis  between  Mersa  Alam  and  north  of 
Hurghada  (Figs.  22,  23).  By  2050,  species  richness  is  predicted  to  decline 
further  in  the  area  between  Cairo,  Ismailia  and  Suez,  coastal  areas  of  the 
Suez and Aqaba gulfs, the Nile Valley between Fayoum and Assiut, Red Sea 
inland  wadis  between  Mersa  Alam  and  north  of  Hurghada,  scattered  areas 
around Wadi El-Natrun,  northern  and central Sinai,  and the Gebel Elba  area 
(Figs. 22, 23). By 2080 the greatest decline in species richness is predicted to 
be from Suez southwards on both sides of the northern part of the Suez Gulf, 
Wadi El-Natrun northwards,  and the  area  between Cairo, Ismailia  and Suez; 
smaller  declines  are predicted  in coastal  areas  around the Suez  and  Aqaba 
gulfs, the Suez Canal, Eastern Desert inland wadis, the Qattara Depression, 
Gebel  Elba,  Siwa  oasis  and  Gebel  El-Hallal  northwards  to  the  North  Sinai 
coast (Fig. 22, 23). 
With  no-dispersal  and  under  the  B2a  scenario,  the  overall  pattern  of 
declines  in  future  species  richness  does  not  differ  much  from  the  A2a 
scenario,  but  greater  declines  are  predicted  in  Wadi  El-Natrun,  the  area 
between Cairo, Suez and Ismailia, and on coastal areas on both sides of the 
Suez Gulf (Figs. 22, 23).

Species Gains and Losses 
Under  both  dispersal  assumptions  and  under  the  A2a  scenario,  the  highest 
predicted  species  loss  by  2020  is  predicted  to  be  in  coastal  areas  on  both 
sides of the Suez Gulf, coastal areas in the lower parts of the Aqaba Gulf, the 
area between the greater Cairo, Ismailia and Suez, Siwa oasis, the base of the 
Qattara Depression, inland wadis between Hurghada and Mersa Alam, coastal 
areas  between  north  of  Berenice  and  Abu  Ramad,  and  Wadi  El-Natrun 
northwards (Fig.  24). By  2050, the pattern of species loss  is predicted to be 
the  same  as  in  2020,  with  greater  loss  around  the  lower  part  of  Suez  Gulf, 
Siwa oasis, inland wadis between Hurghada and El-Quseir, northwestern parts 
of  Sinai,  around  Farafra  oasis,  Wadi  El-Natrun  and  in  the  Nile  Valley  from 
Fayoum to Minia; losses are predicted to decrease near Berenice (Fig. 24). By 
2080,  there  is  predicted  to  be greater  species  loss  in the  area  between  the 
greater  Cairo,  Ismailia  and  Suez,  south  of  Suez  on  both  sides  of  the  Suez 
Gulf,  and Wadi  El-Natrun  northwards;  somewhat  less  in  the  area  extending 
from  central  to  north  Sinai,  northern  and  eastern  parts  of  the  Qattara 
Depression,  the  Berenice  area  and  scattered  locations  on  the  north  coast. 
Inland wadis between Hurghada and El-Quseir show smaller losses compared 
to 2050 (Fig. 24).  
  Under  the  B2a  scenario,  the  overall  pattern  of  species  loss  is  much 
greater than predicted under the A2a scenario (Fig. 24). By 2020, there will be 
large losses  on both sides  of the Suez Gulf, Wadi El-Natrun northwards, the 
area  between  the  greater  Cairo,  Ismailia,  and  Suez,  inland  wadis  between 
Hurghada and El-Quseir, and coastal areas of the southern part of the Aqaba 
Gulf; these are somewhat less in the Berenice area, Siwa oasis, northern and 
eastern  parts  of  the  Qattara Depression  and  the  Gebel Elba  area.  By  2050, 
the  same  pattern  is  predicted,  with  greater  losses  in  Wadi  El-Natrun 
northwards,  the  area  between  the  greater  Cairo,  Ismailia  and  Suez,  coastal 
areas on both sides of the Suez Gulf, Siwa oasis and the Qattara Depression; 
these  are  a  bit  lower  in  coastal  areas  of  the  Mediterranean  from  Sallum  to 
Sinai,  inland  wadis  near  Gebel  El-Hallal  westwards,  around the Farafra  and 
Bahariya oases, coastal areas of the northern part of the Aqaba Gulf, around 
Fayoum and the Gebel Elba area. By 2080, the overall pattern of species loss 
does change from that of 2050, with smaller numbers of species being lost on 
- 56 - 
the Mediterranean coast, around Bahariya oasis and Fayoum, northern Sinai, 
the Qattara Depression and northern coastal areas of the Aqaba gulf. 
In  terms  of  species  loss  relative  to  current  (thresholded)  species 
richness, under the A2a scenario the highest relative loss by 2020 is predicted 
to be in the Western Desert oases (Bahariya, Dakhla, and Kharga oases, and 
Siwa  oasis  south-eastwards),  El-Gilf  El-Kebir,  both  sides  of  the  Nile  Valley 
between  Fayoum  and  Aswan,  and  inland  wadis  between  Mersa  Alam  and 
Gebel El-Gallala (Fig. 25). This pattern is predicted not to change by 2050, but 
with  relative greater declines  in the Western Desert  oases (except  Bahariya) 
and relatively smaller declines in El-Gilf El-Kebir and inland and coastal areas 
of  the  northern  half  of  the  Eastern  Desert,  followed  by  Suez  Gulf  coasts  in 
Sinai  and  the  North  Coast  (Fig.  25).  By  2080,  Western  Desert  oases  are 
predicted to undergo greater relative losses (except Bahariya where the areas 
of  high  relative  loss  shrink), followed  by  the  Mediterranean  coast  (especially 
south-east of Sallum), the northern part of the Suez Gulf in Sinai, the area east 
of  greater  Cairo  and  northern  and  central  parts  of  the  Nile  Delta.  Areas  of 
earlier high relative species loss in the northern part of the Eastern Desert are 
predicted to shrink in area by 2080 (Fig. 25).  
Under  B2a  scenario,  the  overall  pattern  of  relative  species  loss  is 
similar to  that  of A2a scenario,  with greater relative  losses in inland wadis  of 
the  northern half of the Eastern Desert,  around Western Desert  oases, Wadi 
El-Natrun  and  the  Mediterranean  coast.  By  2050,  there  is  predicted  to  be 
greater relative loss in the area between Gebel Elba and Wadi El-Allaqi (Fig. 
25). 
Under  unlimited  dispersal  and  the  A2a  scenario,  the  highest  gains  in 
species  by  2020  are  predicted  to  be  on  the  Mediterranean  coast  west  of 
Alexandria, central and south-eastern parts of the Qattara Depression, eastern 
and central Sinai northwards towards Gebel El-Hallal, Bir Abraq,  and coastal 
areas north and south of El-Quseir (Fig. 26). By 2050, the predictions have the 
same  overall  pattern  of  species  gain,  with  an  expansion  in  area  on  the 
Mediterranean coast,  the Qattara Depression  and central to north  Sinai;  and 
with  smaller  gains  at  Bir  Abraq  (Fig.  26).  By  2080,  there  is  predicted  to  be 
continuing  increases  in  gains  on  the  Mediterranean  coast,  the  Qattara 
- 57 - 
Depression,  north  of  Siwa,  scattered  areas  on  both  sides  of  the  Nile  Valley 
from  Fayoum  southwards,  Gebel El-Maghrabi  east  of  Edfu,  Gebel  El-Gallala 
and coastal  areas between Hurghada  and Mersa Alam; somewhat smaller in 
areas  on  both sides  of the  northern part  of the Suez Canal and the Western 
Desert oases (Fig. 26).  
Under the B2a scenario and unlimited dispersal, there is predicted to be 
an  overall  increase  in  gains  across  Egypt  relative  to  the  A2a  scenario.  By 
2020,  the  highest  increase  in  species  gains  is  predicted  to  be  on  the 
Mediterranean  coast,  the  Qattara  Depression,  areas  around  the  Nile  Valley 
from  north  of  Fayoum  to  Edfu,  the  Western  Desert  oases,  Bir  Abraq,  the 
coastal  area from  north  of Hurghada to south  of  El-Quseir, Gebel  El-Gallala, 
the  area  extending  from  eastern  and  central  Sinai  northwards  to  Gebel  El-
Hallal,  south  of  Rafah,  and  areas  on  both  sides  of  the  northern  part  of  the 
Suez Canal (Fig. 26).  By  2050,  a large proportion  of the  northern half  of the 
Western  Desert  is  predicted  to  gain  many  more  species  (including  the 
Mediterranean  coast  and  Siwa  oasis,  with  the  highest  gains  in  the  Qattara 
Depression). Areas with high predicted gains also include the Western Desert 
oases,  the  Tushka  area  northwards,  areas  on  both  sides  of  the  Nile  Valley 
from  north  of  Fayoum  southwards,  Bir  Abraq,  the  northern  part  of  the  Nile 
Delta, Gebel El-Gallala, coastal areas from north of Hurghada to Mersa Alam, 
an area extending from central to northwestern Sinai and south of Rafah (Fig. 
26). By 2080, the pattern of areas of highest predicted gains is similar to that 
of  2050,  with  contractions  in  some  areas  including  around  Western  Desert 
oases,  Tushka,  around  the  Nile  Valley,  the  northern  Nile  Delta,  Gebel  El-
Gallala,  south  of  Rafah  and  the  Red  Sea  coast  from  north  of  Hurghada  to 
Mersa Alam (Fig. 26). 
Predicted  gains  in  species  relative  to  current  (thresholded)  species 
richness  under  the  A2a  scenario  by  2020  are  highest  on  both  sides  of  the 
lower  Nile  Valley  from  Qena  southwards,  Tushka  area,  west  of  Fayoum 
towards  the  west  and  south  of  the  Bahariya  oasis,  and  north  and  south  of 
Siwa; these are somewhat smaller west and north-west of Farafra, the Qattara 
Depression  northwards  towards  inland  areas  of  the  Mediterranean  coast, 
scattered  areas  in  central  Sinai,  Kharga  southwards  and  westwards,  and  a 
small area south of Damietta (Fig. 27). By 2050, the overall predicted pattern 
- 58 - 
is similar,  with increases in the centre  of the Qattara Depression  northwards 
and  an  area  extending  from  west  of  Fayoum  towards  west  and  south  of 
Bahariya (Fig. 27). By 2080, there are predicted to be even greater increases 
in  both  area  and  magnitudes  in the  Qattara Depression  northwards  towards 
inland  areas  of  the  Mediterranean  coast,  north  and  south  of  Siwa,  an  area 
extending  from  west  of  Fayoum  towards  west  and  south  of  Bahariya  oasis, 
around  Dakhla  and  Kharga,  and  on  both  sides  of  the  lower  Nile  Valley 
especially mountainous areas of the Eastern Desert (Fig. 27).  
Under the B2a scenario, the overall pattern of relative gain shows much 
higher  magnitudes  compared  to  the  A2a  scenario.  By  2020,  the  predicted 
pattern of relative gains resembles that of 2080 for the A2a scenario, and by 
2050 and 2080, there is predicted to be large areas with relatively high gains, 
mainly in the Qattara Depression  northwards,  around Western Desert  oases, 
west  and  north  of  Fayoum  and  around  the  lower  part  of  the  Nile  Valley 
especially in mountainous areas of the Eastern Desert (Fig. 27). 
 
Species Turnover 
Under unlimited dispersal and the A2a scenario, by 2020 the highest predicted 
turnover  in  species  composition  is  predicted  to  be  in  the  Western  Desert 
(south-east  of  Bahariya  westwards  to  the  Libyan  borders,  around  Dakhla, 
around Kharga  down  to the Sudanese borders,  and north  of El-Gilf El-Kebir) 
and  around  the  Nile  Valley  from  Assiut  southwards;  values  are  somewhat 
lower  west  and  south  of  Fayoum,  north  and  north-west  of  the  Qattara 
Depression, and in the Bir Abraq area, as well as scattered inland wadis in the 
Eastern  Desert  (Fig.  28).  By  2050,  a  similar  pattern  is  predicted,  with  slight 
declines  in  turnover  west  of  Farafra  near  the  Libyan  borders  (Fig.  28).  By 
2080, the pattern again does not change much, with greater expansion in the 
areas  of  high  turnover  around  the  southern  part  of  the  Nile  Valley  and  the 
Western Desert (south and west of Kharga and Dakhla); and slight increases 
in turnover in the greater Cairo area, Wadi El-Natrun westwards to Libya, the 
central  Nile  Delta  and  in  central  to  northern  Sinai  (Fig.  28).  Under  the  B2a 
scenario, the predicted pattern of species turnover resembles that of the A2a 
scenario,  but  with  an  overall  increase  in  the  areas  of  high  turnover,  and 
- 59 - 
especially  by  2050  continuing  to  2080,  almost  all  the  southern  half  of  the 
Western Desert is predicted to  undergo  high turnover in species composition 
(Fig. 28). 
When  no-dispersal  is  allowed,  under  the  A2a  scenario  the  highest 
turnover  in  species  composition  by  2020  is  predicted  to  be  in  the  Bahariya 
oasis south-westwards towards the Libya border, around Kharga and Dakhla, 
El-Gilf El-Kebir, scattered areas on both sides of the lower Nile Valley from El-
Minia southwards, south  of Siwa  and scattered  mountainous locations in the 
middle of the Eastern Desert (Fig. 29). The predicted pattern does not change 
much by 2050  and 2080, with high  declines predicted for  Farafra westwards 
by 2050, and increases in El-Gilf El-Kebir by 2050 and 2080 (Fig. 29). Under 
the  B2a scenario,  the  overall  pattern  of  predicted  species  turnover  does  not 
differ  much  from  the  A2a  scenario,  but  with  greater  increases  in  El-Gilf  El-
Kebir,  south  of  Siwa,  and  areas  around  Bahariya,  Kharga,  and  Farafra.  By 
2050  and  2080,  there  is  predicted  to  be  a  moderate  increase  in  species 
turnover in the central Nile Delta westwards to the Mediterranean coast and in 
scattered mountainous areas of the Eastern Desert (Fig. 29). 
 
Range Changes  
With  unlimited  dispersal,  no  species  is  predicted  to  become  extinct  in  the 
future  under  all  or  the  average  of  the  global circulation  models.  There  are  a 
couple  of  species  predicted  to  become  extinct  by  losing  their  entire  area  of 
suitable habitat in at least  one  of the future projections: Tarentola  mindiae is 
predicted  to  become  extinct  by  2080  under  both  emission  scenarios  of  the 
CSIRO  and  NIES99  models,  and  under  the  A2a  scenario  of  the  HadCM3 
model;  and  Hemidactylus  robustus  is  predicted  to  become  extinct  by  2080 
under  both  emission  scenarios  of  the  CSIRO  model,  and  under  the  A2a 
scenario of the HadCM3 model (Table 10 - Fig. 30). 
Using  the  average  gain  or  loss  of  suitable  habitat  across  the  four 
different global circulation models (Table 10), only one species is predicted to 
be classified as Critically Endangered (i.e. predicted to lose more than 80% of 
suitable habitat) by 2020: this species is Hemidactylus robustus under the A2a 
scenario.  By  2050,  two  species  are  predicted  to  be  classified  as  Critically 
- 60 - 
Endangered  under  both  emission  scenarios  (Hemidactylus  robustus  and 
Tarentola  mindiae).  The  number  of  such  species  is  predicted  to  increase by 
2080  to  eight  species:  four  under  both  emission  scenarios  (Eumeces 
schneiderii,  Malpolon  moilensis,  Tarentola  mindiae  and  Trapelus  mutabilis), 
three  under  only  the  A2a  scenario  (Cerastes  vipera,  Eryx  jaculus  and 
Ptyodactylus  guttatus)  and  one  under  only  the  B2a  scenario  (Hemidactylus 
robustus) (Tables 10, 12 - Fig. 30). 
Five  species  are  predicted  to  be  classified  as  Endangered  (i.e. 
predicted  to  lose  50-80%  of  suitable  habitat)  by  2020:  one  under  both 
emission  scenarios  (Tarentola  mindiae),  one  under  only  the  A2a  scenario 
(Pristurus  flavipunctatus)  and  three  under  only  the  B2a  scenario 
(Hemidactylus  robustus,  Malpolon  moilensis  and  Ptyodactylus  guttatus).  By 
2050,  six  species  are  now  predicted  to  be  classified  as  Endangered  under 
both  emission  scenarios  (Eryx  jaculus,  Eumeces  schneiderii,  Malpolon 
moilensis,  Pristurus  flavipunctatus,  Ptyodactylus  guttatus  and  Trapelus 
mutabilis). By 2080, 16 species are predicted to be so classified: seven under 
both  emission  scenarios  (Acanthodactylus  longipes,  Agama  spinosa, 
Leptotyphlops  macrorhynchus,  Naja  haje,  Pristurus  flavipunctatus, 
Ptyodactylus siphonorhina and Tarentola mauritanica), six under only the A2a 
scenario  (Hemidactylus  robustus,  Laudakia  stellio,  Psammophis  schokari, 
Sphenops  sepsoides,  Uromastyx  aegyptia  and  Walterinnesia  aegyptia)  and 
three  under  only  the  B2a  scenario  (Cerastes  vipera,  Eryx  jaculus  and 
Ptyodactylus guttatus) (Tables 10, 12 - Fig. 30). 
Eight species are predicted to be classified as Vulnerable (i.e. predicted 
to  lose  30-50%  of  suitable  habitat)  by  2020:  two  under  both  emission 
scenarios  (Eryx  jaculus  and  Trapelus  mutabilis),  three  under  only  the  A2a 
scenario (Malpolon moilensis, Ptyodactylus guttatus and Stenodactylus petrii) 
and  three  under  only  the  B2a  scenario  (Pristurus  flavipunctatus,  Uromastyx 
aegyptia  and Walterinnesia aegyptia). By  2050,  eleven species  are predicted 
to  be  classified  as  Vulnerable:  seven  under  both  emission  scenarios 
(Acanthodactylus  longipes,  Leptotyphlops  macrorhynchus,  Naja  haje, 
Ptyodactylus  siphonorhina,  Tarentola  mauritanica,  Uromastyx  aegyptia  and 
Walterinnesia  aegyptia),  one  under  only  the  A2a  scenario  (Cerastes  vipera) 
and  three  under  only  the  B2a  scenario  (Agama  spinosa,  Telescopus  dhara 
- 61 - 
and  Tropiocolotes  tripolitanus).  By  2080,  ten  species  are  so  classified:  six 
under  both  emission  scenarios  (Acanthodactylus  aegyptius,  Malpolon 
monspessulanus,  Scincus  scincus,  Telescopus  dhara,  Tropiocolotes 
tripolitanus  and  Uromastyx  ocellata),  one  under  only  the  A2a  scenario 
(Stenodactylus  petrii)  and  three  under  only  the  B2a  scenario  (Psammophis 
schokari,  Uromastyx  aegyptia  and  Walterinnesia  aegyptia)  (Tables  10,  12  - 
Fig. 30). 
Twenty-two  species  are classified  as  Least  Concern (i.e.  predicted  to 
lose  less  than  30%  of  suitable  habitat)  by  2020:  13  under  both  emission 
scenarios,  six  under  only  the  A2a  scenario  and  three  under  only  the  B2a 
scenario.  By  2050,  16  species  are  so classified:  seven  under  both  emission 
scenarios,  seven  under  only  the  A2a  scenario  and  two  under  only  the  B2a 
scenario.  By  2080,  only  six  are  so  classified:  four  under  both  emission 
scenarios and one each under only the A2a or B2a scenarios (Tables 10, 12 - 
Fig. 30). 
For those that are predicted to gain rather than to lose range under the 
unlimited dispersal assumption, three species  are  predicted to  gain less than 
30% of their current range under all combinations of time slices and emission 
scenarios.  Some  species  are  predicted  the  same,  but  not  under  all 
combinations of times and scenarios. By 2020, there are 28 of these species: 
16 under both emission scenarios, four under only the A2a scenario and eight 
under  only  the  B2a  scenario.  By  2050,  there  are  17  of  these  species:  five 
under both emission scenarios, six under only the A2a scenario and six under 
only the B2a scenario. By 2080, there are ten such species: three under both 
emission scenarios, two under only the A2a scenario and five under only the 
B2a scenario (Tables 10, 12 - Fig. 31). 
Twelve species are predicted to gain 30-50% of their currently occupied 
area  by  2020:  four  under  both  emission  scenarios,  six  under  only  the  A2a 
scenario  and  two  under  only  the  B2a  scenario.  By  2050, there  are seven  of 
these  species:  one  under  both  emission  scenarios,  one  under  only  the  A2a 
scenario and five under only the B2a scenario. By 2080, there are eight such 
species: two under both emission scenarios, four under only the A2a scenario 
and two under only the B2a scenario (Tables 10, 12 - Fig. 31). 
- 62 - 
Ten  species  are  predicted  to  gain  50-80%  of  their  currently  occupied 
area by  2020: three under  both emission scenarios, four  under  only the A2a 
scenario  and three  under  only  the  B2a scenario. By  2050, there  are  14 such 
species: nine at both  emission scenarios, three  under  only the A2a scenario 
and two under  only  the  B2a scenario. By 2080, there are  nine such species: 
two under both emission scenarios, two under only the A2a scenario and five 
under only the B2a scenario (Tables 10, 12 - Fig. 31). 
Five species are predicted to gain 80-100% of their currently occupied 
area  by  2020:  two  under  both  emission  scenarios,  two  under  only  the  A2a 
scenario  and  one under  only the B2a scenario. By 2050, there  are  four such 
species: one under both emission scenarios, one under just the A2a scenario 
and  two  under  just  the  B2a scenario.  By  2080,  there  are  five  such  species: 
three under just the A2a scenario and two under just the B2a scenario (Tables 
10, 12 - Fig. 31). 
Five  species  are  predicted  to  gain  more  than  100%  of  their  currently 
occupied  area  under  all combinations  of time slices  and  emission  scenarios. 
Some species are predicted to gain the same under at least one combination. 
By 2020, there are three under just the B2a scenario. By 2050, there are ten 
such species: eight under both emission scenarios and two under just the B2a 
scenario.  By  2080,  there  are  18  such  species:  13  under  both  emission 
scenarios,  four  under  just  the  A2a  scenario  and  one  under  just  the  B2a 
scenario (Tables 10, 12 - Fig. 31). 
The  percentages  of  species  falling  under  each category  are  shown  in 
Fig. 33 a &amp; b. The overall trend in predicted gain/loss (Fig. 34) indicates that 
under  the  assumption  of  unlimited  dispersal  there  will  be  a  continuous 
increasing gain in range for the average species with time, with little difference 
between emission scenarios; by 2080 under the A2a scenario there is slightly 
more  gain  and  more  variability  than  expected.  The  average  range  change 
across  different  taxonomic  groups  seems  to  be  the  highest  for  Varanidae 
(160%  by  2020,  and  up  to  600-800%  increase  by  2080);  while  for  other 
groups, this ranges from 6% to 156% increase (Fig. 35). 
When  assuming  no  dispersal  at  all,  of  course  no  gains  in  area  are 
possible,  merely  losses.  Again  no  species  is  predicted  to  become  extinct 
- 63 - 
under  all  global  circulation  models.  Two  species  are  predicted  to  become 
extinct  in  at  least  one  of  the  projections:  Tarentola  mindiae  is  predicted  to 
become extinct by 2050 under the A2a scenario, and by 2080 at both emission 
scenarios  of  the  CSIRO  model,  and  also  under  the  A2a  scenario  of  the 
HadCM3 model; and Hemidactylus robustus is predicted to become extinct by 
2080 under both scenarios of the CSIRO model, and under the A2a scenario 
of the HadCM3 model (Tables 11, 13 - Fig. 32). 
One  species  is  predicted  to  be classified  as  Critically Endangered  by 
2020 (Hemidactylus robustus - under the A2a scenario). Three species are so 
classified by 2050: two under both emission scenarios (Hemidactylus robustus 
and  Tarentola  mindiae)  and  one  under  just  the  A2a  scenario  (Trapelus 
mutabilis).  There  are  ten  such  species  by  2080:  five  under  both  emission 
scenarios  (Eumeces  schneiderii,  Malpolon  moilensis,  Ptyodactylus  guttatus, 
Tarentola  mindiae  and  Trapelus  mutabilis),  four  under just  the  A2a scenario 
(Acanthodactylus  longipes,  Cerastes  vipera,  Eryx  jaculus  and  Ptyodactylus 
siphonorhina)  and  one  under just  the B2a scenario (Hemidactylus  robustus) 
(Tables 11, 13 - Fig. 32).  
Seven species  are predicted  to  be classified  as Endangered by 2020: 
five  under  both  emission  scenarios  (Malpolon  moilensis,  Pristurus 
flavipunctatus,  Ptyodactylus  guttatus,  Tarentola  mindiae  and  Uromastyx 
aegyptia)  and  two  under  just  the  B2a  scenario  (Hemidactylus  robustus  and 
Trapelus  mutabilis).  By  2050,  there  are 11 species  so  classified:  nine  under 
both  emission  scenarios  (Acanthodactylus  longipes,  Eryx  jaculus,  Eumeces 
schneiderii,  Malpolon  moilensis,  Pristurus  flavipunctatus,  Ptyodactylus 
guttatus,  Ptyodactylus  siphonorhina,  Telescopus  dhara  and  Uromastyx 
aegyptia) and one under each of A2a and B2a scenarios (Cerastes vipera and 
Trapelus  mutabilis,  respectively).  In  2080,  there  are  22  such  species:  nine 
under  both  emission  scenarios  (Agama  spinosa,  Leptotyphlops 
macrorhynchus,  Naja  haje,  Pristurus  flavipunctatus,  Sphenops  sepsoides, 
Tarentola  mauritanica,  Telescopus  dhara,  Tropiocolotes  steudneri  and 
Uromastyx  aegyptia),  seven  under  just  the  A2a  scenario  (Acanthodactylus 
aegyptius,  Hemidactylus  robustus,  Laudakia  stellio,  Psammophis  schokari, 
Scincus  scincus,  Uromastyx  ocellata  and  Walterinnesia  aegyptia)  and  six 
under just the B2a scenario (Acanthodactylus longipes, Cerastes vipera, Eryx 
- 64 - 
jaculus,  Platyceps  saharicus,  Psammophis  sibilans  and  Ptyodactylus 
siphonorhina) (Tables 11, 13 - Fig. 32). 
Thirteen species are classified as Vulnerable by 2020: eight under both 
emission  scenarios  (Acanthodactylus  longipes,  Eryx  jaculus,  Leptotyphlops 
macrorhynchus,  Mesalina  pasteuri,  Platyceps  saharicus,  Psammophis 
sibilans, Ptyodactylus siphonorhina and Telescopus dhara), one under just the 
A2a  scenario  (Trapelus  mutabilis)  and  four  under  just  the  B2a  scenario 
(Agama spinosa, Echis pyramidum, Tropiocolotes steudneri and Walterinnesia 
aegyptia).  By  2050,  there  are  17  such  species:  13  under  both  emission 
scenarios  (Acanthodactylus  aegyptius,  Agama  spinosa,  Leptotyphlops 
macrorhynchus,  Naja  haje,  Platyceps  saharicus,  Psammophis  schokari, 
Psammophis  sibilans,  Spalerosophis  diadema,  Sphenops  sepsoides, 
Tarentola mauritanica, Tropiocolotes steudneri, Tropiocolotes tripolitanus and 
Walterinnesia aegyptia), two under just the A2a scenario (Laudakia stellio and 
Scincus  scincus)  and  two  under  just  the  B2a scenario  (Cerastes  vipera  and 
Mesalina  pasteuri).  By  2080,  20  species  are  so  classified:  six  under  both 
emission  scenarios  (Chalcides  ocellatus,  Echis  pyramidum,  Malpolon 
monspessulanus,  Platyceps  florulentus,  Spalerosophis  diadema  and 
Tropiocolotes  tripolitanus),  eight  under  just  the  A2a  scenario  (Eirenis 
coronella, Mesalina bahaeldini, Naja nubiae, Ophisops occidentalis, Platyceps 
saharicus,  Psammophis  sibilans,  Stenodactylus  petrii  and  Tropiocolotes 
bisharicus)  and  six  under  just  the  B2a  scenario (Acanthodactylus  aegyptius, 
Laudakia stellio, Psammophis schokari, Scincus scincus, Uromastyx ocellata 
and Walterinnesia aegyptia) (Tables 11, 13 - Fig. 32).  
Thirty-five  species  are  predicted  to  be  classified  as  Least  Concern 
under  all possible combinations  of time slices  and emission scenarios. Other 
than  these  species,  some  species  are  so  classified  under  at  least  one 
combination  of  settings.  25  species  are  predicted  to  be  classified  as  Least 
Concern by 2020: 21 under  both emission scenarios  and four under just the 
A2a  scenario.  By  2050,  14  species  are  so  classified:  eleven  under  both 
emission  scenarios,  one  under  just  the  A2a  scenario  and  two  under  just  the 
B2a  scenario.  By  2080,  there  are  seven  such  species:  one  under  both 
emission scenarios and six under just the B2a scenario (Tables 11, 13 - Fig. 
32).  
- 65 - 
The percentages of species predicted to be in each category under the 
no-dispersal assumption are shown in Fig. 33 c &amp; d. The overall trend (Fig. 34) 
indicates that there will be a continuous increase in species loss through time, 
with  few  differences  between  emission  scenarios  except  a  greater-than-
expected  loss  by  2020 under  the B2a  scenario  and  by  2080  under the  A2a 
scenario. The average range decline across different taxonomic groups seems 
to be  low for Varanidae (3-5% loss), followed by the tortoises (10-20%). The 
highest  average  loss  by  2020  is  predicted  for  the  Agamidae  (21-28%), 
followed by the Gekonidae (25%) and then the snakes (19-24%). By 2050, the 
highest average loss is predicted for the Geckonidae (31%), Agamidae (30%), 
snakes (29%) and Scincidae (26%); by 2080, for Agamidae (37-42%), Snakes 
(35-39%), Scincidae (32-39%) then by Gekonidae (36-38%) (Fig. 35). 
 
Reptile species classifications 
According  to the  current  IUCN  Red  List  website  (http://www.iucnredlist.org/), 
19  Egyptian  reptiles  have  been  assessed  globally:  one  is  classified  as 
Critically  Endangered  (Testudo  kleinmanni),  two  as  Vulnerable 
(Acanthodactylus  pardalis  and  Trapelus  savignii)  and  16  as  Least  Concern. 
Fifty-six  species  have  not  been  classified  globally  yet.  Among  the  reptile 
species excluded from this study, two near-endemic species are in the IUCN 
global  Red  List:  Philochortus  zolii  is  Critically  Endangered  [B1  ab(iii)]  and 
Telescopus  hoogstraali  is  Endangered  [B1ab(iii)]  (Böhme  &amp;  Baha  El  Din 
2006b; Disi et al. 2006). According to Egypt’s  national Red  List  assessment, 
three  species  are classified  as  Endangered  (Leptotyphlops  cairi,  Chamaeleo 
africanus and Uromastyx ocellata), 24 as Vulnerable and 48 as Least Concern 
(for  the  global  and  national  IUCN  classification  of  the  Egyptian  reptiles,  see 
Table 5). 
According  to  their  world  distribution,  6  species  are  classified  as 
Endemic  or Near-Endemic  (Acanthodactylus  aegyptius,  Mesalina  bahaeldini, 
Tarentola  mindiae,  Testudo  kleinmanni,  Trapelus  savignii  and  Tropiocolotes 
bisharicus),  eight  as  Restricted  (Acanthodactylus  pardalis,  Naja  nubiae, 
Ophisops  occidentalis,  Ptyodactylus  siphonorhina,  Sphenops  sepsoides, 
Stenodactylus  mauritanicus,  Uromastyx  ornata  and  Walterinnesia  aegyptia), 
- 66 - 
52  species  as  Narrow  and  9  as  widespread  (Table  5).  Two  endemics 
(Hemidactylus  foudaii  and  Tropiocolotes  bisharicus)  and  five  near-endemics 
(Acanthodactylus  pardalis,  Philochortus  zolii,  Platyceps  sinai,  Telescopus 
hoogstraali and Tropiocolotes nubicus) were not included in this study due to 
their limited number of unique records. 
According to  their  distribution  within Egypt, nine species  are classified 
as Localized (Eirenis coronella, Mesalina bahaeldini, Mesalina pasteuri, Natrix 
tessellata,  Ophisops  occidentalis,  Platyceps  florulentus,  Stenodactylus 
mauritanicus, Uromastyx ornata and Varanus niloticus), 31 as Narrow and 35 
as Widespread (Table 5). 
Species  with  highest  weighting  scores  were  found  to  be  Testudo 
kleinmanni, Trapelus savignii,  Acanthodactylus pardalis, Mesalina bahaeldini, 
Ophisops  occidentalis,  Stenodactylus  mauritanicus,  Uromastyx  ornata, 
Tarentola mindiae and Tropiocolotes bisharicus (Table 5).  
 
Reptile records in Protected Areas 
Using  database  records,  the  highest  number  of  recorded  species  per 
Protected Area  was found at St Katherine, followed by Gebel Elba, Wadi El-
Gemal  and  Lake  Qarun  (Table  14).  No  records  were  available  from  eight 
Protected  Areas  (Saluga  &amp;  Ghazal,  Ashtum  El-Gamil,  Sanur  Cave,  Nile 
Islands, Red Sea northern islands, El-Dababya, El-Sallum Gulf and Mt Kamel 
Meteor).  Using  the  thresholded  predicted  distributions,  the  number  of 
climatically  suitable  species  per  Protected  Area  was  found  to  be  highest  at 
Lake Burullus, Nabq, Gebel Elba, Ashtum El-Gamil, Taba and Wadi El-Gemal 
(Table  14).  There  is  a  non-significant  correlation  between  the  number  of 
recorded  and  climatically  suitable  species  across  Protected  Areas  (n=23, 
r s =0.49,  p=0.12  one-tailed  –  Fig.  36).  The  highest  difference  between  the 
number of predicted and recorded species was for Lake Burullus, Nabq, Siwa, 
Abu  Galum,  Ras  Mohamed,  Taba  and  Al-Ahrash.  There  is  a  significant 
positive  correlation  between  the  area  of  the  Protected  Areas  and  both  the 
number  of  recorded  species  (n=23,  r s =0.64,  p=0.001  –  Fig.  37)  and  the 
number of predicted climatically suitable species (thresholded) (n=23, r s =0.46, 
p=0.03 – Fig. 37). 
- 67 - 
Under the assumption of unlimited dispersal and the A2a scenario, the 
highest predicted loss of species by 2020 is predicted to be at Ras Mohamed, 
followed by Lake Qarun, Wadi El-Assuti, Wadi Degla and the White Desert. By 
2050,  Wadi  Degla  is  predicted  to  lose  the  most  species,  followed  by  St 
Katherine, Wadi Allaqi, Zaranik, Wadi El-Assuti, the White Desert and Wadi El-
Rayan.  By  2080,  again  Wadi  Degla  is  predicted  to  lose  the  most  species, 
followed  by  Ras  Mohamed,  Zaranik,  Wadi  Allaqi,  the  White  Desert,  St 
Katherine, Lake Qarun, El-Omayed and Wadi El-Gemal (Table 14). Under the 
B2a scenario, the highest predicted species loss by 2020 is predicted to be at 
Ras Mohamed, followed by Wadi Degla, the White Desert, Wadi El-Assuti, St 
Katherine  and  Lake  Qarun.  By  2050,  the  highest  is  Wadi  Degla,  Ras 
Mohamed  and  the White  Desert;  and  by  2080, Wadi Degla, Wadi  El-Assuti, 
the White Desert and Zaranik (Table 14). 
Under the A2a scenario, the highest predicted species gain by 2020 is 
for El-Dababya, Siwa  and El-Omayed; by 2050, Siwa,  Lake Qarun and Wadi 
El-Assuti;  by  2080,  Siwa  and Taba  (Table 14).  Under  the  B2a scenario,  the 
highest  predicted species  gain by 2020 is for Siwa  and the White  Desert; by 
2050, Wadi El-Assuti, Siwa and the White Desert; by 2080, El-Omayed, Siwa 
and the White Desert (Table 14). 
Under the assumption of no-dispersal and the A2a scenario, the highest 
number  of  species  lost  by  2020  is  predicted  to  be  at  Wadi  Degla,  Ras 
Mohamed,  Wadi  Allaqi  and  the  White  Desert;  by  2050,  Wadi  Degla,  Wadi 
Allaqi  and  Zaranik;  and  by  2080,  Wadi  Degla,  Ras  Mohamed,  Zaranik  and 
Nabq (Table 14). Under the B2a scenario, the highest predicted species loss 
by 2020 is at Ras Mohamed and Wadi Degla; by 2050, Ras Mohamed, Wadi 
Degla and the White Desert; and by 2080, Wadi Degla, Ras Mohamed, Wadi 
El-Assuti, White Desert and Zaranik (Table 14). 
 
Area prioritization for conservation 
Using the assumption of ‘additive benefit function’, the areas with the highest 
current  prioritization  value  were  located  on  the  Mediterranean  coast  from 
Rafah  to Sallum,  high-elevation  areas  of  South  Sinai,  the  Suez  Canal  area, 
greater Cairo  north-  and  eastwards  towards  Suez,  Ismailia  and  Sharqia  and 
- 68 - 
southwards  towards  Fayoum  and  El-Minia,  the  area  between  Cairo  and 
Alexandria (including Wadi El-Natrun), coastal areas of both Suez and Aqaba 
Gulfs,  the  Red  Sea  coast,  the  Gebel  Elba  area,  Siwa  oasis,  the  Qattara 
Depression (especially the central  and northern parts), scattered locations in 
the  Nile Valley  from  Qena  to Aswan,  inland  areas  of  North  Sinai  (Gebel  El-
Hallal), the Nile Delta, around Farafra and Kharga oases, inland wadis in the 
Eastern Desert, and moderate-elevation wadis in South and central Sinai (Fig. 
38). 
The overall pattern of prioritization value does not seem to change very 
much  in  climate  projections  into  the  future.  According  to  the  A2a  scenario, 
there will be a restricted decline confined to small area south of Siwa oasis (by 
2020) and small wadi area west of Safaga (at all time slices) (Figs. 38, 39). By 
2050,  prioritization  value  is  predicted  to be increased  in the  Bir Abraq  area, 
Gebel  El-Gallala  southwards,  western  parts  of  central  Sinai,  east  and south-
east of Suez, Siwa oasis, inland western parts of the Mediterranean coast, the 
area  between  west  of  Bahariya  oasis  and  Fayoum,  inland  wadis  between 
Mersa Alam and Safaga, and a small area on the Sudanese border (southwest 
of Wadi El-Allaqi) (Figs. 38, 39). By 2080, there is predicted to be more areas 
characterized  by increased prioritization  value,  including west  of Qarun  Lake 
and west of Bahariya oasis; followed by a large proportion of the northern part 
of  the  Western  Desert,  inland  wadis  in  the  Eastern  Desert  (from  Gebel  El-
Gallala  to  Gebel  Elba),  both  sides  of  the  Nile  Valley  from  Fayoum  to  Edfu, 
around the Kharga, Dakhla and Farafra oases, and eastern and western parts 
of central Sinai (Figs. 38, 39).  
In the B2a scenario, by 2020 and 2050, there will be restricted declines 
in prioritization value confined to south of Siwa oasis, a small area north of El-
Gilf El-Kebir and scattered locations in Eastern-Desert wadis (between Mersa 
Alam  and Safaga) (Figs. 38, 39). By 2050, prioritization  value  is predicted  to 
increase in the Abraq area southwards to Gebel Elba, Gebel El-Gallala, inland 
areas  of  the  Mediterranean  coast,  Siwa  oasis,  west  of  Fayoum  towards 
Bahariya  and  eastern  and  western  parts  of  central  Sinai  (Figs.  38,  39).  By 
2080,  there  will  be  more  such  priority  areas,  including  a  major  part  of  the 
northern half of the Western Desert, the Abraq area southwards to Gebel Elba, 
inland  wadis  from  Gebel  El-Gallala  southwards  to  El-Quseir,  the  Nile  Valley 
- 69 - 
between Fayoum and Edfu, central Sinai, and around the Farafra, Dakhla and 
Kharga oases (Figs. 38, 39).  
The  mean  prioritization  value  in  all  models  was  found to be higher  in 
Protected Area than outside them, with overall a slight increase in prioritization 
value in the future.  The  difference in  prioritization  value  between  inside  and 
outside Protected Areas seems to decline in the future, especially by 2050 and 
2080 under the B2a scenario (Fig. 42). 
Using  the  ‘core-area  function’  assumption,  areas  with  the  highest 
current prioritization value were located in high-elevation wadis in South Sinai, 
Gebel Elba, Siwa oasis, the northern part of the Qattara Depression, the Suez 
Canal  area,  coastal  areas  of  the  Aqaba  Gulf,  Red  Sea  coastal  areas  from 
south of Safaga to south of Halayeb, the Mediterranean coast from Sallum to 
Rafah  and the Nile Valley from Qena to the Sudanese  border. Slightly lower 
priority  was  given  to  non-coastal  areas  in  North  Sinai  (Gebel  El-Hallal);  the 
greater Cairo  area  eastwards to Ismailia  and Suez, westwards towards Wadi 
El-Natrun and southwards in the Nile Valley towards Fayoum and Qena; and 
coastal areas on both sides of the Suez Gulf (Fig. 40). 
The overall pattern of prioritization value does not seem to change very 
much  in  the  future,  but  there  are  more  changes  than  when  additive  benefit 
function was used. Under the A2a scenario, prioritization value is predicted to 
decline  by 2020  in El-Gilf  El-Kebir,  around  Farafra  oasis  and south  of  Siwa; 
while  increase  north  of  Siwa,  south  of  the  Qattara  Depression,  around 
Bahariya, south-east  and south-west  of Suez,  east  of El-Gilf El-Kebir (on the 
Sudanese border) and near Hurghada (Figs. 40, 41). By 2050, the pattern of 
prioritization  value  decline  resembles  that  of  2020,  but  with  greater  decline 
around Farafra  oasis,  and  increases  from  around  Fayoum  westwards  to the 
southern  part  of  the  Qattara  Depression,  north  of  the  Qattara  Depression, 
north  of  Siwa,  east  of  El-Gilf  El-Kebir  eastwards  to the Nile  Valley,  the  Red 
Sea  coast  between  west  of  El-Quseir  to  Gebel  El-Gallala,  western  parts  of 
central Sinai and Bir Abraq southwards to small areas of Gebel Elba (Figs. 40, 
41).  By  2080,  the  overall  pattern  of  prioritization  value  change  does  not 
change much from 2050: there are greater declines around Siwa, and smaller 
declines  (and  shrinking  areas)  around  Farafra;  but  increased  prioritization 
- 70 - 
value  in  both  area  and  amount  in  some  areas,  especially  west  of  Fayoum 
towards the Qattara Depression and east of El-Gilf El-Kebir (Figs. 40, 41). As 
under  the  B2a  scenario,  prioritization  value  is  predicted  to  decline  by  2020 
south  of  Siwa,  around  Farafra,  El-Gilf  El-Kebir,  east  of  Cairo  and  west  of 
Hurghada; while increase north of Siwa, south of the Qattara Depression, east 
of Bahariya, around Fayoum, along the Red Sea coast from Gebel El-Gallala 
to  south-west  of  Safaga,  east  of  El-Gilf  El-Kebir  on  the  Sudanese  border, 
south-east of Aswan and eastern and western parts of central Sinai (Figs. 40, 
41).  By  2050,  prioritization  value  is  predicted  to  decline  in  El-Gilf  El-Kebir, 
south  of  Siwa,  around  Farafra  and  in  between  the  greater  Cairo  and  Suez; 
while increase between Fayoum and south of Fayoum westwards to the Libya 
border, the southern  part  of the Western Desert  near  Sudan,  north  of El-Gilf 
El-Kebir,  Bir  Abraq  southwards  to  Gebel  Elba,  Eastern  Desert  inland  wadis 
from Gebel El-Gallala to Safaga and scattered locations in central Sinai (Figs. 
40, 41). By 2080, prioritization value is predicted to decline in El-Gilf El-Kebir, 
south  of  Siwa,  around  Farafra  and  east  of  Cairo;  while  increase  in  an  area 
extending from Fayoum southwards to El-Minia  and westwards to the Libyan 
border, Red Sea inland wadis from Gebel El-Gallala southwards to El-Quseir, 
Bir  Abraq  southwards  to  Gebel  Elba,  around  the  Nile  valley  from  Edfu 
southwards  and  westwards  (including  Tushka),  and  scattered  locations  in 
central Sinai (Figs. 40, 41). 
Mean  prioritization  value  in  all  cases  were  found  to  be  higher  inside 
Protected Area than outside, with overall a moderate increase predicted in the 
future (except by 2020 under the A2a scenario). The difference in prioritization 
value  between inside  and  outside Protected Areas seems to  be  higher using 
the ‘core area’ rather than the ‘additive  benefit’ function,  with slightly smaller 
differences in the future (Figs. 42, 43).

Fig. 24: Potential future species loss as a result of anthropogenic climate change (assuming both dispersal assumptions: unlimited and no-
dispersal). 
 
For each  species  possible  future  projection,  currently  suitable pixels  predicted  to  loss  its  suitability  in the  future  are  exported  to 
separate  files,  then  average  loss  across  different  global  circulation  models was  calculated.  The  summation  of  mean  future  loss 
across species was then performed to show which area will potentially loss much species in the future. Colour gradient indicate how 
much species will be lost in the future: grey indicates no species loss, dark green indicates low species loss, and dark red indicates 
high species loss.

Discussion 
 
Model performance 
From  the  AUC  values,  the  models  of  all  species  discriminated  much  better 
than random; with all species having a mean AUC value greater than 0.7, this 
indicated at least an overall moderate discrimination ability. About 73% of the 
species had a mean AUC value greater than 0.9, indicating high discrimination 
ability (Franklin 2009). The negative correlations found between AUC and the 
area occupied, and with the extent of occurrence, concur with findings of other 
studies  (e.g.  Brotons  et  al.  2004;  Elith  et  al.  2006;  Hernandez  et  al.  2006). 
Species ecological characteristics have been shown to affect model accuracy, 
with  more  localized  or  rarer  species  being  easier  to  model  with  higher 
accuracy than widespread species, regardless of sample size. This is probably 
because rare species are usually habitat specialists, show low environmental 
tolerance,  and  are  environmentally  or  geographically  restricted  compared  to 
widespread species (Stockwell &amp; Peterson 2002; Brotons et al. 2004; Elith et 
al. 2006; Hernandez et al. 2006; Jiménez-Valverde et al. 2008; Franklin et al. 
2009;  Newbold  et  al.  2009b).  Widespread  species  are  more  likely  to  be 
generalists occupying a wide range of habitats and climates, making it difficult 
to distinguish between suitable and unsuitable habitats (Franklin et al. 2009). 
This result may require further scrutiny (Elith et al. 2006), as it is very easy to 
get  high  AUC  scores  when  modelling  species  distributions  with  low  relative 
occurrence area (the proportion between the extent of species records and the 
extent  of  the  study  area  –  i.e.  high  extrapolation)  (Jiménez-Valverde  et  al. 
2008; Lobo et al. 2008). The smaller is the relative occurrence area (localized, 
rare,  or  endemic  species),  the  greater  is  the  number  of  available  absences 
outside the limits of species records and better the model describes the data; 
this  may  be  an  inevitable  result  for  species  with  small  relative  occurrence 
areas  (Jiménez-Valverde  et  al.  2008;  Lobo  et  al.  2008).  Accordingly,  some 
have advised against using AUC to compare model performances of species 
having different relative occurrence areas (Lobo et al. 2008). Given that most 
of the Egyptian herpetofauna (about 60%) are narrowly distributed, occupying 
less than 10% of Egypt’s area (Baha El Din 2006a), this may be the reason for 
- 107 - 
having high mean AUC scores in this study. This is one of the main drawbacks 
of using AUC for testing model accuracy (Lobo et al. 2008). 
There  is  no  evidence  of  a  strong  correlation  between model  accuracy 
and  the  number  of  records  used  to  run  the  models  (see:  Elith  et  al.  2006; 
Newbold et al. 2009b). The weak negative correlation found in this study does 
not concur with the findings of other studies (e.g. Stockwell &amp; Peterson 2002; 
Kadmon  et  al.  2003;  Hernandez  et  al.  2006),  which  found  that  species  with 
larger sample sizes seemed to have higher model accuracy (but see: de Pous 
et al. 2011). A possible reason for my finding is that the  majority  of Egyptian 
reptiles  have  localized  distributions  with  few  records  compared  to  the  large 
study area, resulting in small relative occurrence areas and consequently high 
model performance. 
 
Variables contributing to the models 
Choosing  the  most  appropriate  variables  that  limit  species  distributions  is  a 
challenge  in  many  species  distribution  modelling  studies.  They  should  be 
selected  on  the  basis  that  they  are  ecologically  meaningful  and  have  high 
explanatory  power  (Beaumont  et  al.  2008).  Environmental  variables  are 
substitutes,  in  general,  for  those  variables  that  affects  species  distribution 
directly  through physiological mechanisms, so poor selection  of the variables 
used in the  model (or the unavailability  of data for  variables thought to have 
direct effects on species distributions) may affect the association between the 
species and the climate (Araújo &amp; Peterson 2012). 
In this study, I used available environmental layers thought to have an 
ecological  meaning.  Altitude  was  found  to be the  most  effective  variable for 
many species. The use of the two NDVI variables in the modelling of Egyptian 
reptiles proved to be not very useful, and probably future studies done on the 
same species and scale should not use them. Maximum NDVI was the most 
important variable only for Echis coloratus (although this information should be 
interpreted  with  caution),  with  an  average  permutation  importance  across 
species of 5.2 ± 5.9. The variable recording the difference between maximum 
and minimum NDVI was not the most important variable for any species, with 
an  average  permutation  importance  across  species  of  2.6  ±  4.1.  NDVI  has 
- 108 - 
been used in many species distribution modelling studies done on a variety of 
species  groups;  including  mammals  (Torres  et  al.  2010;  Hu  &amp;  Jiang  2011; 
Soultan  2011), reptiles (Zabalaga  2009; Costa  et  al. 2010; Kgosiesele 2010; 
Taheri 2010; Carvalho et al. 2011;  de Pous  et al.  2011; Huang et  al. 2011), 
amphibian  (Tarkhnishvili  et  al.  2009;  Beukema  et  al.  2010),  birds  (Niamir 
2009),  and  even  fungi  (Flory  et  al.  2012).  Some  studies  show  a  high 
importance of NDVI in species distribution modelling applications (e.g. Egbert 
et al. 2002; Anderson et al. 2006; Kgosiesele 2010; Taheri 2010), while others 
show  only  minor  contributions  (e.g.  Torres  et  al.  2010;  Soultan  2011).  In 
Soultan’s study on the effect of climate change on Egyptian antelopes, NDVI 
had only a minor contribution to the models (Soultan 2011). As most of Egypt 
area  is  almost  bare,  except  the  Nile  Valley  and  the  Nile  Delta,  a  large 
proportion of Egypt has very small NDVI values, making their use in modelling 
Egyptian fauna questionable. 
The habitat map produced by the BioMAP project seems to have made 
only  a  low  contribution  to  the  reptile  models  (with  an  average  permutation 
importance  across species  of 3.9  ±  5.1), the most important  variable for just 
one  species  (Leptotyphlops  macrorhynchus).  This  may  be  because  of  the 
series of conversions and rescaling processes that converted it from vector to 
a relatively  coarse raster  format,  or  because many  of  the  habitat  categories 
are correlated with other variables, such as altitude. 
Neither  slope  nor  aspect  were  used  to  run the  models,  although  they 
are thought to affect the reptile distributions. They have been used in two other 
species  distribution  modelling  studies  done  on  Egyptian  antelopes  and  a 
relatively  high contributions  to  the  final  models  were  found (El Alqamy  et  al. 
2010;  Soultan  2011).  Having  an  average  indication  of  either  slope  or  aspect 
across Egypt at the coarse resolution used here (~ 5 km) seems not to be that 
helpful. Giving  just  one  value for  either  of them  on  a grid  of 25-km
2
 squares 
does not provide accurate information (especially with the moderate degree of 
uncertainty  associated  with some  species  records).  Involving  them  in  further 
studies  at  smaller  scales  may  be  more  useful;  these  would  need  high-
resolution  variables  and  records  with  only  minor  levels  of  positional 
uncertainty.

Species richness and turnover 
The pattern of species richness of the Egyptian herpetofauna from this study is 
consistent  with  the  findings  of  (Baha  El Din  2006a  -  see  Fig.  44).  The  main 
pattern of herpetofauna hotspots in Egypt was found to be around the greater 
Cairo (including  Wadi  El-Natrun  and Fayoum  area), North  Sinai,  Gebel Elba 
area, and margins of Nile Delta eastwards to the Suez Canal area. Despite the 
high degree of concordance, this study shows fewer numbers of species in the 
high mountains of South Sinai, the Gebel Elba area and the western parts of 
the Mediterranean coast.

per  a  grid  of  half  degree,  comparing  the  results  of  (Baha  El  Din 
2006a) (left) to the results of this study (right). 
 
The  current  predicted  pattern  of  species  richness  (using  either 
probability or thresholded distributions) is consistent with the recorded species 
richness,  but  gives  more  emphasis  to  the  Suez  Canal  area,  western 
Mediterranean  coast,  both sides  of  the  Suez  Gulf  and  a narrow  strip  across 
the  northern part  of  the Nile  Delta.  Gathering  information  from  other studies 
discussing the species richness pattern of different taxonomic groups in Egypt 
is very helpful to show which areas share highest biodiversity or require more 
protection. Although produced with different methodologies, adding up species 
richness  maps  of  this  study  to  those  of  butterflies  and  mammals  (Gilbert  &amp; 
Zalat  2008;  Basuony  et  al.  2010)  indicates  the  most  important  biodiversity 
areas.  Using  the  accumulated  pattern  of  species  richness  of  these  three 
groups, the hotspots of biodiversity were at the periphery of greater Cairo, in 
the high mountain  areas  of South Sinai, the coastal  areas  of the Aqaba  and 
- 110 - 
Suez  gulfs,  the  Suez  Canal  area  and  the  narrow  strip  on  the  Mediterranean 
coast from Rafah to Sallum (Fig. 45). A separate study is probably needed to 
focus  on  producing  such  a  map  using  one  consistent  methodology  and  a 
greater variety  of species  groups,  to show  areas  of highest species richness 
across Egypt.

2010) 
 
There are no published studies known to me that discuss the effect of 
climate change on Egyptian reptiles (see above), obviating any comparison of 
main  findings  of  this  study  to  others.  Information  on  the  reptiles  in  adjacent 
countries  (e.g.  Sudan  and  Libya)  is  very  limited,  making  it  not  possible  to 
compare  patterns  of  species  distributions,  or  make  assumptions  about 
possible  compensations  or  migrations  of  Egyptian  reptiles  as  a  result  of 
climate change. Areas predicted to lose a high number of species in the future 
(and so potentially require more attention; assuming either dispersal abilities) 
are the Suez Canal area, coastal  areas  of both Suez  and Aqaba  gulfs, Wadi 
El-Natrun, around the greater Cairo, Siwa oasis and small inland wadis of the 
Red Sea. Other areas are predicted to benefit from climate change, increasing 
their number of species (assuming unlimited dispersal); these include the area 
between  the  west  Mediterranean  coast  to  the  Qattara  Depression,  middle  to 
north Sinai, Red Sea coastal areas, Western Desert oases, and southern parts 
of the Nile Valley (for more details, see above). This indicates that some areas 
- 111 - 
with currently high predicted species richness  may  lose many species in the 
future; some  of these  areas  are already under  a certain degree  of  protection 
and  so  it  might  be  easier  to  maintain  them  in  the  future  (e.g.  Siwa  oasis). 
Others (e.g. Wadi El-Natrun, the Suez Canal area and Red Sea inland wadis) 
are unprotected and measures are needed to conserve them (see later). The 
Qattara  Depression  may  benefit  from  species  shifting  away  from  Siwa  and 
Wadi  El-Natrun;  some  species  from  inland  Red  Sea  wadis  are  predicted  to 
shift  eastwards to Red  Sea coastal  areas. This  is not likely to happen in the 
near future because  of the  limited  dispersal  ability  of  most  Egyptian reptiles. 
For  a  country  like  Egypt  with  limited  resources  and  budgets  dedicated  to 
wildlife  conservation,  attention  and  effort  may  have  to  be  concentrated  in 
important  areas  that  are  predicted  to  lose  species  in  the  future,  rather  than 
expanding the current Protected Areas network to cover those areas predicted 
to  increase  species  richness  in  the  future,  especially  since  most  reptiles 
probably  cannot  track  suitable  climatic  conditions  in  the  near  future.  Some 
areas  with increased  species  richness  in the  future  are not  well-investigated 
yet  (e.g.  the  Qattara  Depression)  and  more  research  is  required  to  indicate 
their need for protection. 
There is only one comparable study of the impact of climate change on 
Egyptian  taxa  -  that  of  Leach  (2011)  on  mammals  and  butterflies.  The 
predicted  future  changes  in  species  richness  as  a  result  of  climate  change 
from my study do not seem to concur with Leach’s. Mammal species richness 
is predicted to decline in the Mediterranean and Red Sea areas (40-60%) and 
increase  elsewhere  (80-100%);  while  for  butterflies  almost  all  of  Egypt  is 
predicted  to  decline  (40-60%)  except  southern  Egypt  which  is  predicted  to 
increase (40-60%) (Leach 2011). 
  Species  richness  by  itself  is  not  adequate  as  an  indicator  of  biotic 
change. It is possible to maintain the same number of species in the future, yet 
change in species composition. The largest change in species composition in 
the future is predicted to be in the great area of the Western Desert (including 
the  oases,  El-Gilf  El-Kebir  area,  and  the  area  between  Wadi  El-Natrun,  the 
Mediterranean coast, the Qattara Depression and Siwa oasis), inland wadis of 
the Eastern Desert and Gebel El-Hallal area. No other studies have discussed 
- 112 - 
the  potential  change  in  future  species  composition  in  Egypt  as  a  result  of 
climate change.  
Fairly similar results are evident in other studies performed on different 
continents or taxonomic groups. In his study on the effect of climate change on 
the  European  reptiles,  de  Pous  (2011)  predicted  high  species  loss  and 
turnover in  a  priority  conservation  hotspot  in  Europe  (the  Iberian  Peninsula), 
with  great  variation  in  the  predicted  patterns  of  future  species  richness  and 
species loss across different future projections. The same study predicted high 
species turnover in most parts of Europe except the central areas (assuming 
unlimited dispersal),  while such areas under  limited dispersal  were restricted 
to three relatively small areas (de Pous 2011). Ihlow et al. (2012) predicted  a 
strong effect of climate change on global chelonian species richness, with the 
highest  impact  on  four  current  chelonian  hotspots,  possibly  because  of  non-
analogous  climate  conditions  in  the  future.  According  to  Maiorano  et  al. 
(2011),  mammal species richness  of the Mediterranean basin is  predicted to 
have  important  changes  in  the  future  due  to  climate  change;  with  highest 
predicted  species  richness  decline  and  highest  species  turnover  in  Spain, 
North Africa and the Middle East. In another study, Currie (2001) predicted the 
effect  of  climate  change  on  species  richness  patterns  in  trees  and  different 
vertebrate  groups  in the  conterminous  United  States.  Climate change  had  a 
variable  effect  on  different  groups:  the  response  of  trees  was  variable,  but 
severe effects were predicted on birds and mammals, while potential benefits 
were predicted for reptiles and amphibians (Currie 2001). A combination of  a 
temperature  increase  of  3°  C  and  a  20%  decline  in  rainfall  was  predicted  to 
lead  to  the  loss  of  about  15%  of  species  richness  in  the  tropical  forests  of 
Mesoamerica (Golicher et al. 2012).  
 
Range Changes &amp; important species for conservation 
Two species are predicted to loss their entire suitable habitats in at least one 
future  projection:  Tarentola  mindiae  and  Hemidactylus  robustus.  Tarentola 
mindiae  is  a  near  endemic  species  recorded  just  from  northwest  Egypt  and 
northern  Cyrenaica  (eastern  Libya);  its  distribution  in  Egypt  is  restricted  to 
Siwa oasis, the Qattara Depression and their periphery (Baha El Din 2006a - 
- 113 - 
see  Fig.  46(a)).  According  to  the  IUCN,  it  is  classified  globally  as  Least 
Concern (Baha El Din 2006c), and nationally as Vulnerable in this study (due 
its  limited  number  of  locations).  From  the  future range changes  predicted  in 
this study, it is classified as Endangered by 2020 and as Critically Endangered 
by 2050 and 2080 (under all emission scenarios and dispersal assumptions). 
Modelling the  current  distribution  of  Tarentola  mindiae shows  that  its  current 
suitable areas are at Siwa oasis and the Qattara Depression, with unconfirmed 
possible  suitability  in  Wadi  El-Natrun,  El-Omayed  protectorate,  and  Lake 
Qarun  &amp;  Wadi  El-Rayan  protectorates  in  the  Fayoum  area.  Further 
investigation on the existence of Tarentola mindiae in Fayoum area and Wadi 
El-Natrun is required, although it is unlikely to be found there due to extensive 
collecting  efforts  done  in  these  areas  without  recording  it.  The  existing 
Protected  Area  of  Siwa  has  a  high  conservation  responsibility  for  Tarentola 
mindiae.  Constructing  a  new  Protected  Area  in  the  easternmost  part  of  the 
Qattara  Depression  (or  expansion  of  El-Omayed  protectorate  southwards) 
seems to be important to conserve this species. 
  Hemidactylus  robustus  is  a  localized  species  that  ranges  from  East 
Africa  coast  from  Zanzibar  to  southern  Egypt,  Arabia,  east  to  Pakistan;  its 
distribution in Egypt is on the Red Sea coast from El-Quseir southwards (Baha 
El Din 2006a - Fig. 46(b)). Hemidactylus robustus has not been classified yet 
for  the  IUCN  Red  List,  and  classified  nationally  as  Vulnerable  based  on  its 
limited  number  of  locations.  Under A2a scenario,  it  is  classified  as  Critically 
Endangered  by  2020  and  2050  and  predicted  to  maintain  part  of  its  lost 
distribution by 2080 (assuming either dispersal assumptions); while under B2a 
scenario, it is classified as Endangered by 2020 and as Critically Endangered 
by 2050 and 2080 (assuming either dispersal assumptions). More than half of 
its  current  distribution  in  Egypt  is  located  within  Wadi  El-Gemal  and  Gebel 
Elba Protected Areas, which indicates that it is hypothetically protected. Both 
protectorates (northwards towards Safaga  on the Red Sea coast) have  great 
responsibility to conserve this species, and such threatened species should be 
taken  in  consideration  before  giving  permission  for  any  new  development 
activities (e.g. tourism) near the Red Sea coast, especially in Wadi El-Gemal 
protectorate. If it is recorded there at high prevalence, a suggested expansion 
of  either  Protected  Areas  is  required  to  cover  unprotected  coastal  zone 
- 114 - 
between  both  protectorates  (north  and  south  of  Berenice),  although  the 
protection of this area should already be the concern of both protectorates as 
it is located very close to their buffer zone. No information is available on the 
distribution  or  the  status  of  Hemidactylus  robustus  in  the  coastal  areas  of 
Sudan, so possible compensation from the south is not clear. 
Other  than  Tarentola  mindiae,  there  are  other  eleven  endemic/near-
endemic  reptile  species.  Three  are  endemic  to  Egypt:  Hemidactylus  foudaii, 
Mesalina bahaeldini and Tropiocolotes bisharicus; and eight are near-endemic 
to Egypt: Acanthodactylus aegyptius, A. pardalis, Philochortus zolii, Platyceps 
sinai,  Telescopus  hoogstraali,  Testudo  kleinmanni,  Trapelus  savignii  and 
Tropiocolotes  nubicus.  Mesalina  bahaeldini  is  a  common  and  widespread 
species that has a world distribution confined to high mountains of South Sinai 
(Baha  El  Din  2006a).  It  is  classified  as  Least  Concern  by  IUCN  (Werner  &amp; 
Baha  El  Din  2006a)  and  as  Vulnerable  in  this  study  (because  of  limited 
number  of  locations).  Climate change is  predicted  to have  mild  effect  on  its 
distribution,  ranging  from  up  to  50%  suitability  gain  (assuming  unlimited 
dispersal) to up to 50% suitability loss (‘Endangered’ - assuming no dispersal).  
Hemidactylus  foudaii  is  a  rare  and  localized  species  that  has  a  world 
distribution  restricted  to  the  Gebel  Elba  region  (Baha  El  Din  2006a).  It  is 
classified  by  IUCN  as  Least  Concern  (Baha  El  Din  2006b)  and  was  not 
assessed nationally in this study due to its limited number of records, although 
it probably should be classified at least as Vulnerable due to its limited number 
of  locations.  It  was  not  possible  to  assess  the  potential  effect  of  climate 
change on the distribution of Hemidactylus foudaii due to the limited number of 
available records.  
Tropiocolotes  bisharicus  has  a  distribution  confined  to  southeast  of 
Egypt, although its range is likely to extend southwards into Sudan along the 
Red Sea (Baha El Din 2006a). It has not yet been classified for the IUCN Red 
List, and was classified as Vulnerable in this study. Climate change seems to 
have  mild  effect  on  its  future  distribution  that  ranges  from  small  gain  (up  to 
30% - assuming unlimited dispersal) to up to 30% loss of its suitable habitats 
(‘Least Concern’), reaching up to 50% loss (‘Vulnerable’) by  2080 under A2a 
scenario (assuming no-dispersal). Almost all the world distribution of Mesalina 
- 115 - 
bahaeldini  is  within  the  St.  Katherine  Protectorate;  this  gives  great 
responsibility  to  St.  Katherine  to  conserve  the  species.  Gebel  Elba 
Protectorate  has  the  responsibility  for  conserving  the  whole  world  range  of 
both Hemidactylus foudaii and Tropiocolotes bisharicus. 
The status of the Egyptian tortoise, Testudo kleinmanni, is a well-known 
issue in Egypt wildlife conservation, and several studies have been carried out 
within the last ten years on its conservation status (e.g.: Geffen 1990; Baha El 
Din et al. 2003; Perälä 2006; Attum et al. 2007). Testudo kleinmanni is a near-
endemic  species  restricted  to  southeastern  corner  of  the  Mediterranean, 
extending as a narrow strip from the western Negev in the east westwards to 
the  Gulf  of  Sirt  in  Libya  (Geffen  1990;  Baha  El  Din  2006a).  It  is  one  of  the 
smallest and most endangered tortoise species in the Mediterranean basin of 
North Africa and the Middle East, with the most restricted range of all tortoises 
in  this  area  (Attum  et  al.  2007).  All  available  records  for  this  species  from 
Egypt (including historic records) are shown in Fig. 46(k). The current realized 
range  of  this  species  is  currently  very  limited,  as  it  has  been  subjected  to 
severe  pressures  in  the  near  past  causing  the  extirpation  of  its  former 
distribution  range  (Baha  El  Din  2006a).  Reasons  for  its  range  reduction 
include severe over-grazing, over-collecting for pet-trade, massive reclamation 
schemes,  and  extensive  habitat  destruction  accompanied  with  coastal 
development  for  tourism  and  urban  expansion  (Geffen  1990;  Baha  El  Din 
2006a;  Attum  et  al.  2007).  It  is  considered  by  some  authors  as  effectively 
extinct  within  Egypt  between  the  early  1970s  and  the  early  1990s  (Perälä 
2003) until two female tortoises were confiscated by an animal collector inside 
El-Omayed Protectorate  in  2003 (Attum  et al.  2007). It seems still to exist  in 
the  wild  in  low  populations  in  two  Protected  Areas;  Zaranik  and  El-Omayed 
(Mindy Baha El-Din, pers. comm.). It is classified globally by IUCN as Critically 
Endangered [A2abcd+3d] (Perälä  2003)  and  as Vulnerable (D2) in this study 
(just  owing to its  very  limited number  of locations). In this study,  all available 
Egyptian  records  of  Testudo  kleinmanni  were  used  to  model  its  suitable 
habitats  in  the  current  and  future.  The  results  show  low  impact  of  future 
climate  change  on  the  distribution  of  Testudo  kleinmanni;  the  effect  ranges 
from  gaining  up  to  50%  more  than  its  historical  distribution  (assuming 
unlimited  dispersal)  to  the  loss  of  less  than  30%  of  its  historical  distribution 
- 116 - 
(‘Least Concern’ - assuming no-dispersal). This shows that climate change is 
not  really  a  major  threat,  except  possible  future  habitat  destruction  from  the 
predicted  rise  in  sea  level  of  the  Mediterranean  Sea.  Suitable  areas  for  the 
distribution  of  Testudo  kleinmanni  (shown  in  Fig.  46-k)  should  not  be 
interpreted as the current predicted distribution of it, but may be considered as 
potential  areas for re-introduction. The current status of the Egyptian tortoise 
in Libya is not clear, although it seems to exist there in higher numbers than in 
Egypt. The major threat for the Libyan populations seems to be over-collection 
for  the  pet-trade,  with  several  confiscations  of  dozens  of  individuals  in  pet 
markets  (Mindy  Baha  El-Din,  pers.  comm.).  There  are  a number  of  captive-
breeding  tortoises  in  two  enclosures  in  Egypt  where  upward  of  70  tortoises 
breed annually (Mindy Baha El-Din, pers. comm.). A separate study is needed 
using  the  Egyptian  tortoise’s  available  records  from  Egypt  and  the  adjacent 
countries to construct a robust model that show the most effective locations for 
re-introduction. In such a study, layers indicating the habitat status of the study 
area  (the  Mediterranean  coast  area  extending  from  the  Negev  towards  the 
Libyan Mediterranean coast) should be used if available. Such layers include 
current  land-uses  (e.g.  agriculture,  tourism,  etc.),  protection  status 
(protected/non-protected), and the habitat destruction status. Areas which are 
not suitable any more for re-introduction should be excluded as not to interfere 
with the model; this includes some areas on the Egyptian Mediterranean coast 
that  have  already  suffered  from  severe  habitat  destruction  in  the  past,  and 
areas with high human populations. 
Trapelus savignii  has  a very small  world range,  existing  in just Egypt, 
Palestine and Israel, with most of its world distribution lying within Egypt (Baha 
El Din 2006a). Its distribution in Egypt is narrow, occupying the area from east 
of  Cairo  eastwards  through  northern  Eastern  Desert  towards  much  of  north 
Sinai (Baha El Din 2006a). It is classified  as Vulnerable  by IUCN (Werner &amp; 
Baha  El  Din  2006b)  and  also  nationally  in  this  study.  Potential  impacts  of 
climate  change  on  the  distribution  of  Trapelus  savignii  seem  to  be  minor; 
ranging  from  gaining  up  to  more  than  100%  of  its  current  occupancy 
(assuming  unlimited  dispersal)  to  the  loss  of  less  than  30%  of  its  current 
occupancy (‘Least Concern’ - assuming no dispersal).  
- 117 - 
Acanthodactylus  pardalis  has  a  restricted  distribution  confined  to 
northwest  Egypt  and  northern  Cyrenaica in  Libya;  its  distribution  in  Egypt  is 
narrow,  extending  from  Cairo  and  Fayoum  northwestwards  towards  Sallum, 
across  the  Mediterranean  coast  (Baha  El  Din  2006a).  It  is  classified  as 
Vulnerable by IUCN (Böhme &amp; Baha El Din 2006a) and also nationally in this 
study.  This  species  is  considered  one  of  Egypt’s  most  threatened  reptiles 
species  and  has  disappeared recently from its previous  distribution (Baha El 
Din 2006a). Habitat degradation and loss (because of large-scale plowing for 
winter cereals agriculture and extensive tourism development), over-collection 
pressure and over-grazing are the major factors causing the destruction of its 
suitable  habitats  between  Alexandria  and  Mersa  Matruh,  leaving  reasonably 
healthy  populations  just  between  Mersa  Matruh  and  Sallum  (Baha  El  Din 
2006a).  Potential  impacts  of  climate  change  on  the  distribution  of 
Acanthodactylus pardalis seem to be  minor; ranging from gaining up to 80% 
(assuming unlimited dispersal) to the loss of less than 30% of suitable habitats 
(‘Least Concern’ - assuming no dispersal).  
Acanthodactylus aegyptius has a restricted distribution that is confined 
to Egypt, northwest  of the Negev  and the Gaza strip; its distribution in Egypt 
includes North Sinai, the northernmost part of the Eastern Desert, throughout 
the northern Western Desert (including Bahariya and Kharga oases, Wadi El-
Natrun  and the  easternmost  edge of the Qattara Depression),  and along the 
west periphery  of the Nile Valley  (Baha  El Din 2007);  and has been recently 
recorded  from  the  west  of  Farafra Oasis  (Werner &amp;  Ashkenazi  2010).  It has 
not  been  assessed  yet  for  IUCN  Red  List,  possibly  because  of  its  recent 
recognition as new species by (Baha El Din 2007), and is classified as Least 
Concern  in  this  study.  A  moderately  high  impact  of  climate  change  on  the 
distribution of Acanthodactylus aegyptius is predicted, with a potential loss of 
up  to  50%  of  its  current  suitable  habitat  by  2050  (‘Endangered’  -  under  all 
emission  scenarios  and  dispersal  ability  assumptions),  reaching  up  to  80% 
loss  by  2080  under  the  A2a  scenario  (‘Critically  Endangered’  -  no-dispersal 
assumption).  
Philochortus zolii is recorded from just three widely separated locations 
in  Egypt  and  southwest  Libya,  with  a  very  restricted  distribution  in  Egypt 
confined to very small saltmarsh tracts  at Wadi El-Natrun  area  (Baha  El Din 
- 118 - 
2006a). It is classified by IUCN as Critically Endangered [B1ab(iii)] because of 
its  presumably  small  extent  of  occurrence  (&lt;100  km
2
),  its  fragmented 
distribution,  and  severe  habitat  destruction  and  quality  decline  in  Egypt  and 
presumably in Libya (Böhme &amp; Baha El Din 2006b). It is considered to be the 
most threatened reptile species in Egypt, due to imminent habitat destruction 
of  Wadi  El-Natrun  area  and  the  pressure  of  over-collection  (Baha  El  Din 
2006a).  
Telescopus  hoogstraali  has  a  small  global  geographical  distribution 
including  just  Sinai,  the  Negev  and  Jordan;  with  a  rare  and  localized 
distribution  in Egypt confined to St. Katherine  area  and Gebel El-Maghara in 
Sinai (Baha  El Din 2006a). It is classified by  IUCN  as Endangered  [B1ab(iii)] 
because  of  its  small  extent  of  occurrence  (&lt;5000  km
2
),  its  fragmented 
distribution, and the continuing decline in the extent and habitat quality (Disi et 
al. 2006).  
Tropiocolotes  nubicus  has  a  world  distribution  confined  to  Egypt  and 
Sudan; with a restricted distribution immediately bordering the southern part of 
the Nile Valley (Baha El Din 2006a). It is classified as Data Deficient by IUCN 
as  it  has  been  recently  described  and  its  full  range,  status,  threats  and 
ecological requirements are uncertain (Bohm &amp; Richman 2010).  
Platyceps  sinai  is  restricted  to  a  small  geographic  area  including  just 
South Sinai, the Negev and Jordan; it has a rare and localized distribution in 
Egypt  and  considered  a  near  threatened  species  in  Egypt  (Baha  El  Din 
2006a). It has not been yet classified for IUCN Red List.  
Available  number  of records for  each of Philochortus zolii, Telescopus 
hoogstraali,  Tropiocolotes  nubicus  and  Platyceps  sinai  was  inadequate  to 
involve them  in  this  study  analyses;  and  hence  their  national  Red  Data  List 
status and the potential impacts of climate change on their distribution can not 
be assessed.  
Zaranik  and  El-Omayed  protectorates  have  the  responsibility  to 
conserve  the  remaining  populations  of  Testudo  kleinmanni  and  to  urge  the 
halting  of  habitat  degradation  around  their  peripheries.  Zaranik  is  the  only 
Egyptian protectorate (with the possible exception of Al-Ahrash) that contains 
Trapelus savignii, giving it greater responsibility to conserve this species. The 
- 119 - 
current distribution  of Acanthodactylus aegyptius is included in  a  two  already 
established  Protected  Areas,  Zaranik  and Wadi  El-Rayan,  which  means  that 
the  populations  at  those  protectorates  are  potentially  protected.  The 
construction of Protected Areas in Wadi El-Natrun and the easternmost part of 
the  Qattara  Depression  can  offer  an  additive  help  in  its  conservation.  The 
current  limited  distribution  of  Acanthodactylus  pardalis  in  Egypt  does  not 
include  any  Protected  Areas.  The  construction  of  a  Protected  Area  on  the 
Mediterranean  coast  between  Mersa  Matruh  and  Sallum  seems  to  be 
essential  for  its  conservation.  Alternatively,  the  expansion  of  the  recently 
declared  marine  protectorate,  El-Sallum  Gulf  to  cover  threatened  habitats 
along  the  western  part  of  the  Mediterranean  coast  could  be  a  measure  to 
protect  this  species.  The  construction  of  a  Protected  Area  in  the  Wadi  El-
Natrun  area seems  to be essential for  the conservation  of Philochortus zolii. 
Protected Areas of South Sinai have the responsibility for the conservation of 
Telescopus hoogstraali and Platyceps sinai; with a possible need to construct 
a  new  Protected  Area  in the  region  of  Gebel El-Maghara close  to  Gebel  El-
Hallal  in  North  Sinai  to  conserve  Telescopus  hoogstraali.  The  current 
distribution  of  Tropiocolotes  nubicus  does  not  include  any  Protected  Areas, 
and so it is assumed not to be protected. Unfortunately, the construction of a 
new Protected Area in the area of lower Nile seems not to be possible due to 
the high number of inhabitants and its extensive agricultural activities. 
Eight  species  are  classified  as  Critically  Endangered  in  at  least  one 
mean  future  projection:  Acanthodactylus  longipes,  Cerastes  vipera,  Eryx 
jaculus,  Eumeces  schneiderii,  Malpolon  moilensis,  Ptyodactylus  guttatus, 
P.siphonorhina  and Trapelus  mutabilis (For detailed results, see  above). The 
conservation  of  these species  should  be considered  in Egypt’s  conservation 
management  plans.  Maps  showing  the  current  distribution  of  each  of  these 
species and their predicted suitable habitats are shown in Fig. 46. 
In this study, three reptile species are classified nationally, according to IUCN 
red  list,  as  Endangered:  Chamaeleo  africanus,  Leptotyphlops  cairi  and 
Uromastyx ocellata. The three species have a narrow distribution in Egypt and 
globally.  First  two  are  not  classified  yet  by  IUCN,  while  the  third,  Uromastyx 
ocellata, is classified as Least Concern (Spawls 2011). There is no predicted 
impact  of  climate  change  on  their  future  distributions,  except  for  Uromastyx 
- 120 - 
ocellata which is predicted to loss up to 50% (Vulnerable) of its distribution by 
2080 due to climate change. 
Other studies discussing predicted future range changes as a result of 
climate change show fairly similar results. Araújo et al. (2006)  predicted less 
deleterious  impacts  of  climate  change  than  expected  beforehand  for  the 
amphibia  and  reptiles  of  Europe,  with  most  species  tending  to  expand  their 
distributions in the future (assuming unlimited dispersal) due to the warming of 
the  cooler  northern  parts  of  Europe,  allowing  new  colonization.  They 
suggested  that  the  highest  loss  of  suitability,  assuming  unlimited  dispersal, 
was  in  the  south-western  parts  of  Europe  (including  the  Iberian  Peninsula), 
while  south-eastern  parts  were  predicted  high  species  gain.  Under  the 
perhaps  more  realistic  assumption  of  no  dispersal,  most  species  were 
predicted  losses in habitat suitability  by  2050 (Araújo  et  al.  2006). In a  more 
recent relevant study, de Pous (2011) predicted that under unlimited dispersal, 
50%  of  European  reptile  species  should  tend  to  expand  in  the  future,  while 
assuming no dispersal predicted that 78% of species would contract. de Pous 
(2011) suggested that eight (unlimited dispersal) or 21 (no dispersal) speceis 
would become extinct in at least one future projection, and a further two were 
consistently projected to undergo &gt; 80% loss of their currently suitable habitats 
(Iberolacerta  bonnali  and  Podarcis  tiliguerta).  Compared  with  the  predicted 
responses  of  Egyptian  reptiles  in  this  study,  de  Pous  (2011)  suggests  that 
European  species  will suffer  more from  climate  change.  There  are no  other 
comparable studies from North Africa or the Middle East. 
From their comprehensive study of the potential responses of terrestrial 
mammals  in  the  Mediterranean  basin  to  climate  change,  Maiorano  et  al. 
(2011) suggested that a substantial number of Mediterranean mammals will be 
severely threatened by 2100, particularly some endemics. Assuming unlimited 
dispersal, responses ranged between 100% loss to substantial gains (almost 
ten-fold)  of currently suitable habitats. One species  was predicted to lose its 
entire suitable  habitat  across all scenarios  and models,  and 16 species were 
predicted  to  become  extinct in at least  one future projection (Maiorano et al. 
2011).  As  before,  assuming  no  dispersal  led  to  greater  losses  and  more 
modest gains, with 21 species predicted to lose their entire suitable habitats in 
at least one future projection (Maiorano et al. 2011).

The  study  by  Ihlow  et  al.  (2012)  predicted  that  climate  change  would 
cause the range contraction of 86% of the global chelonian species, with about 
12%  of  the  species  predicted  to  be  completely  located  outside  their  current 
realized niche. Sauer et al. (2011) suggested a predicted average range loss 
of  70-80%  of  freshwater  assemblages  within  low  mountain  ranges  by  2080; 
range change varied from almost complete loss to  modest gains  of currently 
suitable  habitats.  Similar  results  were  found  by  Domisch  et  al.  (2011)  on 
macroinvertebrates  of  the  submontane  regions  of  Central  Europe,  with 
predicted  extinction  of  one species to substantial range gains  of  others.  Ben 
Rais Lasram  et  al. (2010)  predicted  a severe impact  of climate change  on  a 
large number of Mediterranean fish species, with 25 and 45 species predicted 
to  be  listed  on  the  IUCN  Red  List  by  2060  and  2100,  respectively.  They 
predicted that 6 and 14 fish species would become extinct by 2060 and 2100, 
respectively,  and  that  the  ranges  of  endemic  species  would  become  highly 
fragmented in the future. 
 
Area prioritization for conservation &amp; Protected Areas coverage 
In  my study, Protected  Areas had  higher mean prioritization  value  (currently, 
and  in  the  future) compared  to  outside  the  protectorates  using  both  additive 
benefit  and  core  area  functions  of  the  Zonation  algorithm.  Using  additive 
benefit function, areas with current high prioritization value are the Suez Canal 
area,  the  Nile  Valley  and  its  Delta,  the  Qattara  Depression,  high  elevation 
wadis in South Sinai, and the coastal areas of the Red Sea, the Mediterranean 
Sea  and  the  Aqaba  &amp;  Suez  Gulfs.  These  areas  also  show  high  species 
richness,  reflecting  the  nature  of  additive  benefit  function  which  gives  more 
weight  to locations  with  high species  richness  (Moilanen  et  al.  2012).  Using 
core-area  function,  areas  with  current  high  prioritization  values  are  high 
elevation wadis in South Sinai, Gebel Elba, Siwa oasis, the Suez Canal area, 
the Red Sea coast, the Mediterranean coast and the Nile Valley. There is not 
much  difference  between  the  overall  patterns  of  areas  of  high  prioritization 
value  using  either  function,  with  overall  higher  prioritization  value  using 
additive benefit function (especially along the north Mediterranean coast from 
Sallum  to Rafah,  Wadi  El-Natrun,  Suez  Canal  area  and  around Cairo).  This 
- 122 - 
result is not as expected; using core-area function should identify important (or 
poor)  locations  where  a  single  or  a  few  species  have  important  occurrences 
(Moilanen  et  al.  2012),  and  this  should  not  be  affected  by  the  pattern  of 
species  richness  unless  these  high  species-richness  locations  also  contain 
important occurrences of single or few species. 
In the future, a higher prioritization value is predicted to be given to the 
area  between  Bir  Abraq  and  Gebel  Elba,  Gebel  El-Gallala  southwards, 
Western  Desert  oases,  western  part  of  middle  Sinai  and  an  area  extending 
from inland areas of the Mediterranean coast to the Qattara Depression. It is 
predicted  also  that  areas  outside  the  protectorates  will  have  higher  mean 
prioritization  value  in  the  future  (especially  using  Additive  benefit  function), 
although  the  mean  prioritization  value  of  Protected  Areas  is  predicted  to 
remain higher than outside them (Figs. 42, 43).  
Although  Protected  Areas  show  higher  mean  prioritization  value  than 
outside  them,  Egypt’s  Protected  Area  network  seems  to  be  inadequate  to 
conserve  Egyptian  reptiles.  New  Protected  Areas  may  be  needed  to  cover 
unprotected  areas  with  high  species  richness  in  the  middle  to  north  Sinai 
(especially around the Gebel El-Hallal area), the Suez Canal area, both sides 
of Suez Gulf and Red Sea inland wadis between Hurghada and Mersa Alam. 
Stricter protection is required in already-established Protected Areas, including 
Gebel Elba, Siwa oasis and the Protected Areas in South Sinai. In the future, 
further protection is needed in areas of the Suez Canal, coasts of South Sinai, 
Wadi El-Natrun,  and Red Sea inland wadis;  and stricter protection  measures 
in already established Protected Areas, such as Siwa and Gebel Elba. 
Regarding  the  potential  future  change  in  species  composition,  more 
attention should be given to the already-established Protected Areas predicted 
to  have  high  species  turnover  in  the  future,  e.g.  Siwa  oasis  and  El-Gilf  El-
Kebir.  More  attention  is  also  needed  in  areas  with  current  high  species 
richness which are predicted to have high species turnover in the future, such 
as Wadi El-Natrun, the Gebel El-Hallal area and inland wadis in the Red Sea: 
these areas may need new Protected Areas. Special concern should be given 
as  well  to  unprotected  areas  with high  prioritization  value;  such  as  the  Suez 
Canal area, the Qattara Depression, and the coastal areas of the Red Sea, the 
- 123 - 
Mediterranean  Sea  and  the  Aqaba  and  Suez  gulfs.  For  already-established 
Protected Areas having high prioritization value, stricter protection is required 
to maintain these areas, e.g. Gebel Elba, the Protected Areas in South Sinai 
and  the  Protected  Areas  near  Western  Desert  oases.  More  fieldwork  is 
required  to  show  the  current  status  of  areas  predicted  to  have  increased 
prioritization value in the future, to evaluate their conservation status and show 
if any of these areas should be declared as new Protected Areas; e.g. Gebel 
El-Gallala,  Gebel  El-Hallal  and  the  Qattara  Depression.  Further  fieldwork  is 
also needed in unprotected areas that contain threatened species, to show if 
any  of these areas  are worth considering  as  new  protectorates. The Qattara 
Depression  seems  to  be  one  of  these  areas,  considered  important  for  the 
conservation  of  Acanthodactylus  aegyptius,  A.  longipes,  Cerastes  vipera, 
Eumeces  schneiderii,  Malpolon  moilensis,  Ptyodactylus  siphonorhina, 
Tarentola  mindiae  and  Trapelus  mutabilis.  Other  such  sites  are  Wadi  El-
Natrun  for  Acanthodactylus  aegyptius,  Cerastes  vipera,  Malpolon  moilensis, 
Philochortus  zolii,  Ptyodactylus  siphonorhina  and  Trapelus  mutabilis  (and 
possibly  Tarentola  mindiae);  the  Gebel  El-Hallal  area  for  Cerastes  vipera, 
Malpolon  moilensis  and  Ptyodactylus  guttatus  (and  possibly  Telescopus 
hoogstraali);  the  Suez  Gulf  coasts  for  Malpolon  moilensis,  Cerastes  vipera, 
Hemidactylus robustus and Ptyodactylus guttatus; and the western part of the 
Mediterranean coast (between Mersa Matruh and Sallum) for the conservation 
of Acanthodactylus pardalis. 
The  area  of  the  Qattara  Depression  is  unexplored  and  not  easy  to 
access. It is one of a number of proposed new Protected Areas characterized 
by high habitat diversity and very high degree of threat (Baha El Din 1998). It 
has  the  highest  priority  among  the  proposed  protectorates,  as  it  supports 
considerable  biodiversity  including  rare  and  endangered  species,  and  is 
considered the last refuge for several endangered key species for Egypt and 
internationally (Baha El Din 1998), despite the paucity of published information 
on the status  of its fauna and flora in the literature. The coastal  areas  of the 
Suez Gulf seem to be an important area for both of reptiles and mammals, and 
also  birds;  It  is  considered  an  important  path  of  bird  migration  and  three 
important  bird  areas  are  located  in  this  area  (Ain  Sukhna,  El-Qaa  plain  and 
Gebel  El-Zeit)  (Baha  El  Din  1999,  2001;  Basuony  et  al.  2010),  with  no 
- 124 - 
Protected Areas on either sides. The area of Ain Sukhna and its periphery has 
been subjected  to  great  pressure in the  last  15  years:  the  high  levels  of  air 
pollution from tonnes of dust spewed out daily after the construction of a large 
cement factory has caused the death of desert vegetation within a radius of 15 
km  (Baha  El  Din  1999,  2001);  rapid  habitat  degradation  from  fast-growing 
tourism, overgrazing and quarrying; and unplanned new government projects 
such as the new shipping port, airport, large tourism-associated activities and 
projects and a heavy-industry zone. All these are thought to jeopardize wildlife 
(Baha El Din 1999, 2001) in the Ain Sukhna area. The El-Qaa  plain (on the 
eastern  side  of  Suez  Gulf)  is  important  for  the  conservation  of  the  Dorcas 
gazelle, as it represents a refuge for the largest remaining population in Sinai, 
and  is  also subject  to unplanned  coastal  tourism  development  (Baha  El Din 
1999,  2001).  The  conservation  importance  of  the  Suez  Gulf  coastal  areas 
should be considered before giving permissions to construct new industrial or 
tourism activities; otherwise the same fate of habitat destruction as happened 
on  the  Mediterranean  coast  will  occur  in  this  area.  The  Suez  Canal  area 
(especially  the  western  side)  shows  high  human  population  and  agricultural 
activity, which may militate against the construction of new Protected Areas in 
this  area.  The  eastern  side  of  the  Suez  Canal  seems  to  have  many  fewer 
sources of disturbance, which makes it potentially suitable for a new Protected 
Area after verification of the current status of its biodiversity. 
Gathering information from other studies discussing the effectiveness of 
Egypt‘s Protected Areas network to cover important biodiversity hotspots can 
help to show  which areas require more  protection  across different taxonomic 
groups.  According  to  Gilbert  &amp;  Zalat  (2008)  and  Basuony  et  al.  (2010),  the 
network seems to be adequate to conserve Egyptian butterfly hotspots, except 
the  Mediterranean  coast  between  Alexandria  and  Sallum,  but  inadequate  to 
conserve  important  mammal  areas,  with  new  Protected  Areas  needed  to be 
constructed in the lower Nile Valley, along the north coast between Alexandria 
and Sallum,  top part  of the Suez Gulf,  and perhaps the Qattara Depression. 
The findings of Basuony et al. (2010) are consistent, to some extent, with the 
results  of  this  study,  with the need  to construct  new  Protected  Areas  at  the 
coasts of Suez Gulf, Mediterranean coast (from Mersa Matruh to Sallum) and 
the Qattara Depression.

Some  other  studies  have  used  Zonation  to  prioritize  areas  for 
conservation,  but  using  other  taxa.  Simaika  (2012)  suggested  that  the 
Protected  Area  network  in  Africa  is  not  enough  to  conserve  its  dragonflies, 
with  a  need  for  the  protection  of  an  additional  5%  of  the  area  of  Africa. 
Klorvuttimontara  (2010)  demonstrated  that  about  50%  of  areas  of  high 
prioritization value in Thailand are currently protected, and that will not change 
very  much  in  the  future.  He  predicted  that  the  conservation  value  of  the 
Protected  Areas  of  Thailand  to  conserve  butterflies  should  remain  similar  in 
the  future,  although increasing  the  quality  of  existing  Protected  Areas  would 
enhance the conservation status of the butterflies species in Thailand. Tognelli 
et al. (2011) showed that the Protected Area network of Argentina contain only 
a  limited  number  of  Xenarthran  mammals,  so  more  Protected  Areas  are 
needed  to  conserve  them.  However,  areas  of  high  prioritization  identified  by 
Zonation were not suitable for new Protected Areas because they are owned 
by  private  landowners  (Tognelli  et  al.  2011).  Simialrly  Corbalán  et  al.  (2011) 
suggested  that  the  current  reserve  network  of  Argentinean  Patagonia  is  not 
enough to conserve its lizard species. 
de  Pous  et  al.  (2011)  used  the  ConsNet  Prioritization  algorithm  to 
assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  Conservation  Area  network  in  Morocco  to 
conserve the herpetofauna under the current climate. They demonstrated the 
need for  a major increase in the  network to guarantee  their conservation. In 
Araújo et  al.’s  study  of  the  effectiveness  of  Protected  Areas  and  the  Natura 
2000  networks  to conserve  European  plant  and  terrestrial  vertebrates  under 
climate change, 58%  and 63%  of these species  were predicted to  be lost by 
2080  from  Protected  Areas  and  Natura  2000  areas,  respectively.  Birds  and 
mammals  were  predicted  to  have  a  higher proportion  of  losers  than winners 
inside  Protected  Areas  in  all  future  scenarios,  whilst  there  was  a  variable 
response  of  amphibians  and  an  increased  suitability for reptiles.  The  Natura 
2000 sites  were less  effective in conservation compared to Protected  Areas, 
although both were  predicted to perform better than  elsewhere, particularly if 
more conservation  efforts  were given  to biodiversity conservation specifically 
against  climate  change  (Araújo  et  al.  2011).  Maiorano  et  al.  (2011) 
demonstrated that the current Protected Areas of the Mediterranean basin will 
strongly be affected by climate change, with highest predicted number of lost 
- 126 - 
species  (25-43%)  located  in  the  drier  Protected  Areas  of  North  Africa,  the 
Middle East  and Spain. Coetzee et al. (2009) showed that  the South African 
Important  Bird  Areas  are  expected  to  be  inadequate  to  conserve  endemic 
birds under climate change, with severe range changes predicted in the future. 
They suggest the need for new Important Bird Areas and Protected Areas to 
conserve the refugia of these species (Coetzee et al. 2009). 
 
The limitations of projecting into the future 
Using  species  distribution  models  for  extrapolations  is  risky  and  must  be 
treated  carefully  (Elith  et  al.  2010;  Araújo  &amp;  Peterson  2012).  Possible 
uncertainties resulting from extrapolation beyond the limits of training data can 
be  assessed from the calculation of the  ‘Multivariate Environmental Similarity 
Surfaces’ (MESS),  available in recent  versions  of  Maxent  (Elith  et  al.  2010). 
MESS is  a measure of the similarity  of  any  given  pixel to a reference set  of 
pixels of chosen predictor variables; it is used to determine novel climates by 
giving  negative  values for  dissimilar pixels  where at least  one  variable  has  a 
value  outside  the  training  range  (Elith  et  al.  2010;  Elith  et  al.  2011).  Novel 
climates can then be used as a mask to inhibit the use of certain areas by the 
models,  or  as  a  measure  of  prediction  uncertainty  (Elith  et  al.  2010).  In  my 
study, MaxEnt  produced MESS maps  at  each possible combination of global 
circulation models, emission scenarios and time slices. The mean MESS value 
across  different  global  circulation  models  in  Egypt  is  shown  in  Fig.  47; 
depicting  which  areas  are  predicted  to  have  novel  climate  conditions  in  the 
future  at  each  possible  combination  of  emission  scenarios  and  time  slices. 
MESS output maps are continuous maps with values ranging from -100 (red) 
to  +100  (blue).  Positive  values  indicate  similar  future  climate  conditions 
compared to the current (the darker the blue, the higher is the similarity), while 
the  negative  values  indicate  locations  of  dissimilar  climate  compared  to  the 
current  (the  darker is  the  red,  the  higher  dissimilarity).  Under  both  emission 
scenarios at 2020 and 2050 and under the B2a scenario at 2080, areas with 
predicted  non-analogue climates  (i.e.  the  most  dissimilar novel  climates)  are 
located  at  east  of  El-Gilf  El-Kebir,  the  Red  Sea  coast  from  Mersa  Alam 
southwards, south  of Wadi  El-Allaqi near the Sudanese  borders, near Qena, 
- 127 - 
and over small patches on the Mediterranean coast and Suez Canal area. By 
2080  and under  A2a scenario,  larger  areas  are  predicted  to  be  subjected  to 
novel  climates,  with  much  higher  degree  of  dissimilarity  extending  to  a  high 
proportion of the Western Desert (including the oases), larger coastal areas on 
the  Red  Sea  (from  south  of  Hurghada  southwards),  eastern  and  northern 
Sinai, the Suez Canal area and around Cairo. The Protected Areas of Wadi El-
Gemal, Gebel Elba and Wadi El-Allaqi (and possibly Siwa, Taba and Zaranik) 
are  therefore  susceptible  to  potential  novel  climates  in  the  future.  Future 
projections  in  areas  of  high  future climate  dissimilarity should  be interpreted 
with caution. 
 
Conclusion 
My results suggest that about 10% of the Egyptian reptiles will suffer greatly in 
the  future  due  to  climate  change.  Eight  species  are  predicted  to  lose  up  to 
80%  of  their  suitable  habitats  in the  future.  The  current  network  of  Egyptian 
Protected Areas appears to be inadequate to conserve Egyptian reptiles; new 
Protected  Areas  are  probably  needed  at  Wadi  El-Natrun,  the  Qattara 
Depression, eastern side of Suez Canal, Gebel El-Gallal area, coastal areas of 
Aqaba  Gulf,  western  Mediterranean  coasts  between  Mersa  Matruh  and 
Sallum,  and  Gebel  El-Hallal  area  in  North  Sinai.  More  strict  protection  is 
required in the Protected Areas of St Katherine, Siwa oasis and Gebel Elba.
