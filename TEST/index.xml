&lt;div id=&#34;r-markdown&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;R Markdown&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see &lt;a href=&#34;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can embed an R code chunk like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary(cars)
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
fit &amp;lt;- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = dist ~ speed, data = cars)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)        speed  
##     -17.579        3.932&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;including-plots&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Including Plots&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also embed plots. See Figure &lt;a href=&#34;#fig:pie&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c(&amp;#39;Sky&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Sunny side of pyramid&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Shady side of pyramid&amp;#39;),
  col = c(&amp;#39;#0292D8&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;#F7EA39&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;#C4B632&amp;#39;),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA

El-Gabbas A. &amp;amp; Dormann C. F.: Improved species-occurrence predictions in data-poor regions: using large-scale data and bias correction with down-weighted Poisson regression and Maxent. Ecography DOI: 10.1111/ecog.03149.
Appendix 1: Supplementary figures and tables Table A1: The estimated optimum combination of Maxentâs feature classes (FC) and Regularization Multiplier (RM) for each species and bias model type. Combinations with highest mean testing-AUC on
5-folds spatial-block cross-validation were selected. All the analyses were performed using modified code from the ENMeval package in R (Muscarella et al., 2014). See main text for more information. Species Environment-only Accessibility Effort a
Feature classes (FC): L linear; Q quadratic; H hinge; P product; and T threshold. For more details see Elith et al. 2011. b RM is a global multiplier to all individual regularization values; for more details see the main text and Muscarella et al.
(2014). Table A2: Estimated best values to run the elastic-net models (DWPR approach) for different species and bias models. For details, see main text. Species Environment-only Accessibility Efforts LASSO RIDGE Fig. A1: Map of all non-marine
GBIF-records. There are clear signs of sampling bias inherited in the GBIF database, disallowing the direct use of these records to run SDMs, unless action is taken to correct for sampling bias. GBIF-records are biased mainly towards Western
Europe, with sparse locations across Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe. Areas shown in white represent pixels without any records (the majority of North and central Africa, Arabia, and eastern Europe). Clearly errorneous records were excluded
before plotting this map.Fig. A2: Left: Map of all GBIF bat records (accessed date: April 2015) per a grid of 20 Ã 20 km2.Right: All records available of the study species, collected either from the literature (blue points) or GBIF (red points).
Both maps show large collection gaps. Fig. A3: Per-species study area: An example of how the âper-speciesâ study area was determined (here for Asellia tridens). The dashed red line indicates the species extent of occurrence (minimum convex
polygon); the solid red line shows the buffer used (1000 km), and the dashed green line indicates the study area used. Fig. A4: Variables selection: Pearson correlation coefficient between each pair of the final covariates; see Appendix 3 for more
information. Fig A5: Per-species number of backgrounds: Objectively determining the adequate number of background âquadratureâ points to be used in GLM and elastic-net models (see main text and Renner et al., 2015). DWPR-GLM models (for each
species, here: Asellia tridens) were repeated 25 times (each time, with a different random sample from the background) with progressively increase the number of background points (from 5000 to 500,000); and for each model, the log-likelihood value
is calculated and plotted. The number of backgrounds at which the likelihood converges (i.e. no much benefit of using a higher number of backgrounds) is, visually, selected to run the final models. Here, no much improvement in the log-likelihood
beyond 300,000 background points (out of 557,800 total available background points) and so we used it for this species. Fig. A6: Determining the best value to run the elastic-net model for Nycticeinops schlieffeni (effort model). Eleven values
ranging from zero (ridge) to one (lasso), with an increment of 0.1, were used to run 11 models on cross-validation. For each value of , glmnet ran many models on a range of -values (estimated from the data; x-axis) and measure the mean
cross-validation error (cvm) (here: Poisson deviance; y-axis). The value with the lowest cvm is used further while predicting (vertical dotted lines, with colours correspond to the value used). Here, an value of 0.6 is shown to have the lowest cvm
and so used further. For more details, see Table A2 and the main text. Fig. A7: Kendallâs correlation between (per-species and modelling algorithm) mean AUC evaluated on spatial-block cross-validation and independent evaluation in Egypt. Each
point represents the mean of 100 AUC values, with different symbols for each species. Colours represent different modelling algorithm used. âMâ indicates the overall mean for each modelling algorithm. Panel (a) shows the correlation for the
environment-only models (no bias correction). Panels (b-c) represent the accessibility model, without and with correcting for sampling bias, respectively. Panels (d-e) represent the effort model, without and with correcting for sampling bias,
respectively. Kendallâs correlation coefficients (and their p-values) are reported in each block. Grey solid line represents the equality line. AUC performed on cross-validation were, on average, higher than AUC in Egypt. However, there is
moderate correlation between bias-free evaluations on either scale. Fig. A8: Equivalent results to Fig. A7, for TSS evaluation. Fig A9: Boxplots of the raw cross-validation evaluation (100 values) without (modelling evaluation; a and c) and with
(bias-free evaluation; b and d) correction for sampling bias; either using AUC (a - b) or TSS (c - d); see Appendix 6 for more information. Horizontal panels show results for different modelling algorithm, while the vertical panels show different
bias models. Panels a &amp;amp; c show results for the environment-only model (without any bias manipulation) and bias-accounting models (accessibility and effort models) without correcting for sampling bias. However, panels b &amp;amp; d compare results for the
environment-only model and bias-accounting models (accessibility and effort models) after correcting for sampling bias (see main text; for effort models, plots show evaluations either conditioning the predictions on a value of zero or the maximum
relative sampling effort of training presences). Species are in ascending order according to their number of occupied pixels at cross-validation scale (with numbers represent the species; see Table 1 for full species names). Fig. A10: Similar to
Fig. A9, but showing results of independent evaluation in Egypt. Evaluation metrics are calculated in Egypt using mean predictions (of 5-folds cross-validation) in Egypt along with entirely independent species records from Egypt (not used to run
any of the models). Species are in ascending order according to their number of occupied pixels in Egypt (with numbers represent the species; see Table 1 for full species names). Fig. A11: Species mean TSS calculated either on cross-validation (a
- b) or in Egypt (c - d), either without (modelling evaluation; a &amp;amp; c) or with (bias-free evaluation; b &amp;amp; d) sampling bias correction (for details, see Appendix 6). Each species is represented by different symbols (similar to those shown in Fig.
A7; numbers represent species used, see Table 1). Red lines indicate the overall mean TSS at each modelling algorithm and bias models applied. Fig. A12: Kendallâs correlation of the per-species mean TSS between different pairs of modelling
algorithms (same as Fig. 2 in the main text, but for TSS). Each species is represented by different symbol (similar to those of Fig. A7) with different colours for different bias models applied (using predictions of environment-only model and
bias-free prediction of accessibility and effort model). âMâ indicates the overall mean evaluation. First row represents mean spatial-block cross-validation evaluation, while the second is for independent evaluations in Egypt. Fig. A13: Values of
bias variables at presences and available locations (backgrounds), at the per-species study area (A) or at local scale âEgyptâ (B). Rows correspond to different species, with numbers indicates the species (see Table 1), and columns represent bias
variables of the accessibility model (distances to roads, cities, and protected areas) and effort model (relative batsâ sampling intensity). For each species, values at presence locations are indicated with black, and values at pixels unoccupied
by the species are shown in grey. Most of the species are recorded from closer to roads and cities (and to some extent, the protected areas), and unexpectedly at low to moderate sampling efforts. Fig. A14: AUC scores calculated the default way
(using all available testing backgrounds â y-axis) versus using a fixed ratio between testing presences and backgrounds (test-data prevalence = 1:20 â x-axis). (A) shows the raw outputs of 5-folds cross-validation. (B) shows the per-species mean
AUC on cross-validation. Different colours represent the three bias models applied (environment-only, accessibility, and efforts). Fig. A15: The predicted distribution of Otonycteris hemprichii (mean of 5-folds cross-validation), using different
modelling algorithms (rows) and bias models (columns). Maps were scaled between zero and one, as different modelling algorithms do not have the same scale, with blue colour indicates higher predicted relative intensity. (A) shows cropped predicted
distribution of Otonycteris hemprichii (the same as Fig. 5) to Egypt. Grey points (in the top left panel) represents available records used for indepenent evaluation presences in Egypt. In Fig. 5 of the main text, extreme values (&amp;gt; 0.9995 quantile
of predicted values) were replaced with their next smaller value to improve map visualization, as GLM and elastic-net models sometimes yielded extreme values. Maps in (B) are equivalent to maps in Fig. 5, without any extreme values manipulation
(using the linear scale), demonstrating the difficulty of visualizing the predicted patterns in the existence of extreme values; see main text for more details. Fig. A16: The reported and predicted distribution of Rhinolophus mehelyi (Maxent). The
2nd to the 4th panels show predictions from environment-only model and bias-free prediction of accessibility and effort models, respectively. Arrows represent regions which gain higher predicted values after correcting for sampling bias (such as
central Turkey or the Algerian Atlas). Predictions at these areas are of higher uncertainty (lower congurrence) and field validation is probably required to confirm the species existence. The lighter the colour, the more suitable the location.

WorldClim : WorldClim provides a global dataset for the elevation and 19 bio-climatic variables interpolated from global monthly temperature and precipitation recordings from weather stations (Hijmans et al. 2005). Tiles for the overall study area
were downloaded at 30 arc-seconds resolution (~1 km near the equator; using the raster R_package), then projected to Mollweide equal-area projection at 5 Ã 5 km2 resolution. The high resolution of 30 arc-seconds was preferred over the 2.5 arc
minutes (~5 km near the equator) in order not to lose much information while re-projecting. Instead of interpolation (assigning a value for the new pixel equals to the mean of the nearest three points at the original projection), a different
approach was employed. First, a template grid covering the study area at the equal-area projection (5 Ã 5 km2) was prepared. Then, pixels of the original variables (at 30 arc-seconds resolution) were converted into centroid points (at the original
projection: WGS-1984), then projected into Mollweide projection, then these points were rasterized using the mean value (or other relevant function for some variables; e.g. maximum for Bio5) of the points that spatially fall within each cell of
the template grid. The same approach was used to prepare all other covariates used in this study. b Global Potential Evapotranspiration (Global-PET) &amp;amp; Global Aridity (Zomer et al. 2007, 2008) : available at the global scale at a resolution of 1
km, and were prepared based on models that use data from WorldClim as inputs. Global Actual Evapotranspiration (Global-AET) &amp;amp; Global Soil-Water-Balance (Global-SWB) (Trabucco &amp;amp; Zomer 2010) : available at the global scale at a resolution of 1 km,
and are prepared based on WorldClim and Global-PET database as primary input. d NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) &amp;amp; EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) (Didan, 2015) : map tiles for the whole study area were downloaded (and merged) for the
period from 18/2/2000 to 22/3/2015 each 16 days (MODIS product: MOD13A2 â resolution: 1 km) using the MODIS R package (Mattiuzzi, 2014). Summary maps (maximum, minimum, mean, range, and standard deviation) across the whole period (for NDVI &amp;amp; EVI)
were produced at the original MODIS scale/projection using a python code in âArcGISâ as this was memory intensive to perform in raster package of R. Each of the summary layers were then projected into the equal-area projection at 5 Ã 5 km2
resolution. Possible covariate transformations were investigated, trying to keep some degree of uniform distributions across the range of each covariate (following: Dormann 2011). For some covariates, no transformation was effective, and they were
kept untransformed. â¢ Variable selection: Multicollinearity amongst the potential covariates )covering the total study area( was assessed, maintaining highest GVIF (Generalized Variance Inflation Factor) 3 (Zuur et al. 2009) [which is equivalent,
in our case, to maintaining a highest absolute correlation coefficient between each pair of covariates 0.6 and highest VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) 10]. This was also checked for each speciesâ study area. Aridity-related covariates
(actual/potential evapotranspiration, aridity-index, and soil-water-balance) were all excluded as they show high collinearity with other WorldClim covariates; unsurprisingly as they were derived from models that use WorldClim data as input. Out of
tensummary vegetation-related covariates, two NDVI covariates were used further: the cumulative minimum and the standard deviation NDVI. They reflect indices of minimum biomass and variability of vegetation-cover across the study area,
respectively. Appendix 4: Per-species spatial-block cross-validation For each species, a different spatial-block cross-validation structure was used to run SDMs. Pixels across the study area were aggregated into larger blocks (each of 20 Ã 20
cells = 100 Ã 100 km2), and blocks were distributed into cross-validation folds. Presences and backgrounds in each block were used together either as training or testing (Fithian et al. 2015). The blocks were not distributed into cross-validation
folds randomly, as this would have yielded highly unbalanced numbers of presence-locations across spatial folds. Instead, we balanced the number of presence locations at different folds by calculating their numbers at each block; the top 5 blocks
were then, sequentially, randomly assigned to five folds (to avoid that the first fold always has the highest number of presences). To avoid high variability in the environmental space between folds and minimise much extrapolation while predicting
to the left-out-fold, blocks without any species records were distributed into folds depending on a mean index of their similarity to the overall study area: using the Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surfaces âMESSâ. MESS was proposed by
Elith et al. (2010) to identify areas of novel climates by comparing future (or past) climate to those used to run the models, as the interpretation of future projections at these locations should be considered with caution. We calculated the
MESS-score for each pixel (and a mean value for each block) quite differently from how it was proposed in the first place: we measured the environmental similarity of each pixel to all available pixels in the study area (using the âdismoâ
package). The original application of MESS gives most dissimilar locations more negative values (Elith et al. 2010); however here we expect no negative values as there is no climates novelty. Blocks without any presence locations are sorted in
descending order (depending on their average MESS value), and then the highest five blocks were distributed randomly into different folds. This was repeated for all blocks until all blocks were distributed to different folds. An example of how
spatial-block cross-validation applied for Asellia tridens. Different colours represent how different blocks are distributed into cross-validation folds. Blue points represent the species known distribution from outside Egypt. For each per
speciesâ study area, a different blocking structure was prepared, to balance the number of presence locations and environmental variability at different cross-validation model runs. Appendix 5: Sampling-effort model Data for closely related
species (bats/non-marine mammals) were downloaded from GBIF (The Global Biodiversity Information Facility â April 2015) and used (along with available focal species records: Tables 1 &amp;amp; A1) to model the relative sampling intensity (surveying
effort) of bats/mammals. The prediction map of this model was used as bias covariate in the âEffort modelsâ (see main text, Fig. 1, bottom right). Records were assessed before usage (records with missing coordinates or with clear errors were
excluded: e.g. missed latitude or longitude / equal latitude and longitude / records in the sea or the ocean / potentially swapped latitude and longitude), resulting in a total of 435,458 bat records / 2,039,158 non-marine mammal records (maps
below). GBIF records (for both bats and mammals) show high bias towards the Western Europe compared to any other area in the study area, followed by scattered locations elsewhere (mostly close to the main cities, water bodies, populated areas, or
seemingly a result of a mammals atlas mapping activity in southwest Africa). The majority of Africa and eastern Europe to western Asia is extremely under-represented in GBIF, with huge gaps in North Africa and Arabia. Maps show the number of GBIF
records of non-marine mammals (left) and bats (right) per a grid of 20 Ã 20 km2 (accessed date: April 2015). Initial trials for modelling the sampling effort were done using DWPR-GLM (Down-Weighted Poisson Regression) and Maxent (both using
PPM-like approach; see main text); without much difference in the resulted prediction pattern (although Maxent model âusing default feature classes and regularization multiplierâ shows, visually, an over-fitted spatial pattern). DWPR-GLM model was
chosen to run at 5Ã5 km2 equal-area projection: all the bats/mammals presence locations as the response (without duplicates removal) and using different covariate set than the environmental variables used to run the species SDMs (Merow et al.
2016) Terrain roughness (represented here as a per-pixel standard deviation of altitude): Altitude maps from WorldClim was downloaded at of 30 arc-seconds resolution [~1 km near the equator], then projected as points in Mollwide equal-area
projection. The points were then converted to a raster (rasterized), representing the standard deviation of the elevation values located at any target pixel at the resolution of 5 Ã 5 km2; Distance to main cities : the Euclidean distance between
the centroid of each pixel and the nearest human settlement; Distance to main roads : the Euclidean distance between the centroid of each pixel and the nearest road (Source: Global Roads Open Access Data Set âgROADSâ); Population count : global
population count in 2000; Protection status : a binary variable indicating the protection status of each pixel [source: The world Database of Protected Areas:]. The overall pattern of the predicted sampling effort for both bats and mammals were
roughly similar (maps below), so the prediction from the bats sampling effort model was used further (as bias covariate in the effort model). It represents the overall relative abundance of bat species sightings per unit area (based only on
non-climatic covariates). The predicted sampling intensity of sightings (sampling effort) for all bats (left) and non-marine mammals (right) using the DWPR-GLM (Down-Weighted Poisson Regression) model. Appendix 6: Mixed effect model analysis of

their interaction (for evaluation in Egypt highest variability was explained by the sampling-bias models, followed by the modelling algorithm, and then their interaction). Again, the number of training presences and study area were much less
important (and the sign of their effects resembles those of modelling evaluation). The accessibility model had lower AUC compared to the two other sampling-bias models in all comparisons (Fig. 3). On cross-validation, bias-accounting models had
lower AUC-values compared to the environment-only model (very little difference between environment-only and effort model for GLM; Fig. 3a). For evaluations in Egypt, environment-only and effort model were hardly different (effort model had lower

correction for sparse presence-only data Abstract Species distribution modelling (SDM) has become an essential method in ecology and conservation. In the absence of survey data, the majority of SDMs are calibrated with opportunistic presence-only
data, incurring substantial sampling bias. We address the challenge of correcting for sampling bias in the data-sparse situations. We modelled the relative intensity of bat records in their entire range using three modelling algorithms under the
point-process modelling framework (GLMs with subset selection, GLMs fitted with an elastic net penalty, and Maxent). To correct for sampling bias, we applied model-based bias correction by incorporating spatial information on site accessibility or
sampling efforts. We evaluated the effect of bias correction on the modelsâ predictive performance (AUC and TSS), calculated on spatial-block cross-validation and a holdout data set. When evaluated with independent, but also sampling-biased test
data, correction for sampling bias led to improved predictions. The predictive performance of the three modelling algorithms was very similar. Elastic-net models have intermediate performance, with slight advantage for GLMs on cross-validation and
Maxent on hold-out evaluation. Model-based bias correction is very useful in data-sparse situations, where detailed data are not available to apply other bias correction methods. However, bias correction success depends on how well the selected
bias variables describe the sources of bias. In this study, accessibility covariates described bias in our data better than effort covariates, and their use led to larger changes in predictive performance. Objectively evaluating bias correction
requires bias-free presence-absence test data, and without them the real improvement for describing a speciesâ environmental niche cannot be assessed. Introduction Species distribution data often come in the form of presence-only, with information
on where species have been recorded, but no reliable information on where they have not, or where people have looked (Pearce and Boyce 2006). Museums, herbaria, personal collections, published literature, and citizen records are valuable sources
for presence-only data (Pearce and Boyce 2006, Newbold 2010), especially in developing countries where there is a lack of systematic nation-wide surveys. Some initiatives make such species sightings freely available: GBIF (the Global Biodiversity
Information Facility â see: http://www.gbif.org) collates global biodiversity data from different sources. One fundamental problem is that data are often incidental with no information on the sampling efforts and survey method used (Pearce and
Boyce 2006). They are biased taxonomically (towards larger, easy to detect, or more charismatic species groups; Newbold 2010), environmentally (less collection effort in areas with harsh environments), temporally (more in summer than winter), and
spatially (near populated places, roads, research institutes and protected areas; Phillips et al. 2009, Newbold 2010, Stolar and Nielsen 2015). For example, GBIF-data show huge differences in data contribution among countries (Supplementary
material Appendix 1, Fig. A1; on average, more from well-financed than from species-rich countries). Spatial bias is a particular concern for statistical analysis when it leads to environmental bias (Phillips et al. 2009), e.g. when large parts of
the environmental space remain unsampled (Merow et al. 2014). Species distribution models (SDMs) relate species occurrences to the environment to estimate habitat preference, and predict potential distribution and responses to climate change
(Phillips and DudÃ­k 2008, Elith et al. 2011). Statistical analyses of presence-only data describe the environment at record locations relative to the background environment, making them more susceptible to sampling bias than presence-absence data
from dedicated surveys (Phillips et al. 2009, Fithian et al. 2015). However, such targeted survey-data are rare (Pearce and Boyce 2006), especially in developing countries, explaining why the majority of SDM applications uses presence-only data.
Presence-only data may produce sound models if they are efficiently corrected for sampling bias (Elith et al. 2011). Point-process models (PPM) have recently emerged as the most appropriate technique for presence-only data (Renner et al. 2015).
PPMs do not use background points as pseudo-absences (as in the naÃ¯ve logistic regression; Fithian and Hastie 2013), but rather as quadrature points for estimating the spatial integral of the likelihood function, and hence require careful tuning
of its number (for details see, e.g., Warton and Aarts 2013). The response variable of PPMs is the density of species records per unit area (also called âintensityâ), which should be proportional to the probability of occurrence (which can not be
estimated empirically using presence-only data without additional information; see: Fithian and Hastie 2013, Renner et al. 2015, Phillips et al. 2017). It is mathematically equivalent to methods already commonly used in ecology, e.g. Maxent and
some implementations of the generalised linear modelling framework, but differently efficient (Renner and Warton 2013, for details, see: Renner et al. 2015). Sampling bias has been addressed by âspatial filteringâ of presence locations (keeping
only a limited number of records within a certain distance) to dilute the effect of uneven sampling effort across the study area (e.g. Anderson and Raza 2010, Boria et al. 2014). Alternatively, others effectively use location of records from
related species as background points to have background points with the same bias as the species records (Elith and Leathwick 2007, &#39;target-group background&#39;: Phillips et al. 2009, see also: Ponder et al. 2001, and &#39;weighted target group&#39;
presented in Anderson 2003). Neither approach is applicable when there are only few data (a typical case in developing countries). For example, to apply the target-group background approach to model the distribution of a bat species in North
Africa, all GBIF bat species records (Supplementary material Appendix 1, Fig. A2) are clearly not enough to serve as representative background points in this large study area. Similar to the target-group background, if the pattern of sampling bias
is known a priori, it can be used as prior weight for sampling the background proportionally to the sampling effort (e.g. &#39;bias file&#39; in Maxent; Phillips and DudÃ­k 2008, Warren et al. 2014), so that both presences and background samples have the
same bias (see also: Stolar and Nielsen 2015). As a third strategy, sampling bias can be addressed also by modelling the distribution of the focal species as a function of two additive covariate sets: the environmental covariates and other
covariate(s) describing potential sources of sampling bias, hereafter âbias covariatesâ (model-based bias correction; Warton et al. 2013). For unbiased predictions, the bias covariates are set to a common level of bias, say 0, at all locations;
however, sometimes it is difficult to settle on a meaningful adjustment level (Warton et al. 2013). The aim of this paper is to address the problem of sampling bias in data-sparse situations and how to correct for it in presence-only SDMs. We
apply model-based bias correction, comparing two different sets of bias covariates to model the distribution of Egyptian bat species in areas of their known global distributions. Bias-models for each of three modelling techniques within the PPM
framework are calibrated with information on either accessibility or sampling effort and compared to an âenvironment-only modelâ. To maintain a reasonable degree of independence between training and testing datasets, we evaluated the models using
a) entirely independent presence-only data (not used to fit any of the models); and b) spatial-block cross-validation. â Materials and methods Species and study area We are interested in understanding the environmental preferences of Egyptian bats
as an example representing the sampling-bias issue in data-sparse situations. We collected records for the entire range of each species (Supplementary material Appendix 1, Fig. A2, latitude: â35Â° to +56Â° and longitude: â20Â° to +80Â°) from the
literature and GBIF (see Supplementary material Appendix 2 for list of literature sources). Although GBIF provides a valuable source of data, such opportunistically compiled data bases inevitably contain misidentified or incorrectly georeferenced
records (Gaiji et al. 2013), and thus require careful revision before use. Relevant records from the GBIF database were assessed (October 2014) and merged with the available literature records. Bat records from Egypt were mostly taken from the
expert-revised BioMAP (Biodiversity Monitoring and Assessment Project) database (Basuony et al. 2010). Only species with enough presence locations that are located in at least 5 larger spatial blocks were included in this study (allowing model
evaluation on spatial-block cross-validation; see below). This was fulfilled by 21 species, each occupying &gt; 20 unique cells at resolution of 5Ã5 km2 (Table 1). The geographical range of records was assessed (based on the literature and IUCN), and
spatial outliers were excluded. The coverage of all available records shows obvious signs of spatial bias towards Western Europe and only sparse sampling in Africa and Western Asia (Supplementary material Appendix 1, Fig. A2). Presence locations
were purposefully split into training and testing data, using only records from outside Egyptâs boundaries for training, thereby keeping the Egyptian presence data as entirely independent evaluation data. For sampling of background points,
however, Egypt was not excluded from the study area, and hence background points can be sampled from Egypt as well (see Fig. 1 for a flowchart of the methods applied). The determination of the study area is critical, especially for presence-only
models (Pearce and Boyce 2006). We decided against a single fixed large study area that covers presence locations of all 21 species to keep only areas of potential accessibility to the bats (Barve et al. 2011) and avoid inflating the
discrimination ability of the model (e.g. higher AUC; Barve et al. 2011). Instead, for each species, the study area was determined based on the geographical extent of the records: a rectangular bounding box containing a 1000 km buffer around the
species extent of occurrence (see Supplementary material Appendix 1, Fig. A3 for an example). We used a buffer of 1000 km, as we found it suitable for the study species âbatsâ, which have, on average, high dispersal ability and large home range.
Potential covariates (and species presences) were projected into Mollweide equal-area projection and rasterised to a resolution of 5 Ã 5 km2. We assessed potential environmental variables for multi-collinearity, and assembled a final list of
covariates with a maximum Generalized Variance Inflation Factor value less than 3 (for details see Supplementary material Appendix 3 &amp; Supplementary material Appendix 1, Fig. A4). Block cross-validation Cross-validation is commonly used for
evaluating model performance when no independent data are available. Random splitting does not guarantee spatial independence due to spatial autocorrelation (both training and testing data will be spatially adjacent), and so may overestimate model
performance (Bahn and McGill 2013, Radosavljevic and Anderson 2014). To maintain independence between folds and improve transferability of models, a spatial form of cross-validation was used by splitting the study area into coarse checkerboard
blocks, and then distribute blocks randomly into folds (Fithian et al. 2015). We performed 5-fold spatial-block cross-validation (hereafter: cross-validation). The larger the block size, the higher is the need for more data to be able to run
models on spatial-block cross-validation. We used blocks of 100 Ã 100 km2 (20 Ã 20 cells), which is not very strong, as we find this more appropriate for the available data. Presence and background locations within each block were used together
for model training or testing: for the three modelling algorithms, potential background locations of the left-out cross-validation fold were not used (masked) during model calibration and were used exclusively for evaluation (similar to &#39;masked
geographically structured approach&#39; of Radosavljevic and Anderson 2014, see also Fig. 7 in Fithian et al. 2015). For each species, we used a different blocking structure, balancing the number of available presences between folds and avoiding
extrapolation in environmental space (for more details see Supplementary material Appendix 4). Sampling-bias models We compared models without bias correction (environment-only model, our reference) with two methods of addressing bias. Firstly, we
considered human accessibility as the main source of sampling bias and ran SDMs with additional bias covariates describing distances to nearest cities, roads and protected areas (the âaccessibility modelâ). For bias-free predictions, we set all
distances to zero; thus, a bias-free prediction can be interpreted as the relative intensity of the target species records if all locations across the study area had perfect accessibility (Warton et al. 2013). Second, assuming relative effort is
the main source of sampling bias, we incorporated a single bias covariate describing the relative intensity of sightings of all bat species (the âeffort modelâ). This sampling-effort bias covariate was actually the prediction from a (different)
all-bats-model, which predicted the number of all records as a function of non-environmental variables (terrain roughness, distance to cities, distance to main roads, human population density, protected area â details in Supplementary material
Appendix 5 and Fig. 1 bottom-right). For bias-adjusted predictions, the sampling-effort covariate needed to be set to a common level, for which there is no obvious choice. We therefore adjusted it to either of two values of sampling effort: the
maximum fitted value at the target species&#39; training presence locations, and at zero. In the first case, the bias-adjusted prediction can be interpreted as the relative intensity of species reporting if all the study area receives the sampling
effort of the best presence location of the target species. In the second case, the bias-adjusted prediction is independent of effort, and the effort covariate is used only to correct the coefficients of the environmental variables. Although the
latter value seems simpler, the predicted values lack intuitive interpretation. As the results were very similar, we here only use the maximum fitted value at training presences. Modelling algorithms For each sampling bias model (environment-only,
accessibility and effort), we employed three modelling algorithms under the PPM framework with cross-validation and adjustment for model complexity: GLM, elastic net, and Maxent. Both GLM and elastic net model the number of records as a Poisson
regression, with elastic net including a mixture of lasso and ridge regularisation (shrinkage; L1- and L2-regularisation, respectively; Friedman et al. 2010). Maxent (v3.3.3k; Phillips and DudÃ­k 2008) is a machine-learning algorithm for
presence-only data, effectively and mathematically akin to a Poisson GLM, but with different functional forms for the predictors; it also applies an ad-hoc form of lasso regularisation (Renner and Warton 2013). We used GLM and elastic net to
implement a âdown-weighted Poisson regressionâ (DWPR, following Renner et al. 2015). This approach uses weights to make the number of presences a negligible proportion of all data and scales the data to the actual area. As a consequence, DWPR
estimates model parameters including the intercept. A small weight (10-6) was assigned to presence locations, while background points were given a higher weight equal to the area of the study region divided by the number of background points used.
To estimate the appropriate number of background points (for GLM and elastic net), 25 repeated series of DWPR-GLMs were run, each one progressively increasing the number of randomly sampled background points. We used the number of background
points at which the log-likelihood asymptoted (Supplementary material Appendix 1, Fig. A5; Renner et al. 2015). For both GLM and elastic-net models, 1) we included linear, quadratic and 1st-order interactions between variables; 2) no interactions
were allowed between the environmental and bias covariates (Warton et al. 2013); 3) we standardised all covariates to a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. For GLMs, a random sample of background points (number estimated from the
asymptoted log-likelihood curve) was used to run an initial model. The initial model was then simplified using AIC-informed backward stepwise selection and the remaining variables were used to cross-validate the final models. Running elastic net
(R package glmnet; Friedman et al. 2010) requires tuning of two parameters, Î± (describes the balance of ridge and lasso) and Î» (degree of regularisation; for more details see: Hastie et al. 2009). For each species and bias manipulation, we
estimated the best combination of Î± and Î» by 5-fold cross-validation of 11 models (Î± ranging from zero to one with an increment of 0.1). For each model, the optimal Î» value was determined by fitting a series of cross-validated models to a range of
Î» values (âregularisation pathâ; by default 100 values estimated from the data) and the Î» value that showed the minimum mean cross-validated error was used for predictions. Similarly, the Î± value with the lowest error (Poisson deviance) was
selected (Supplementary material Appendix 1, Fig. A6). To report the performance of the elastic net (and for comparisons with the results of other techniques), the selected values of Î± and Î» were used to run the cross-validation models manually.
Due to the computational limitation of explicitly using a user-defined Î» during model training (stated by glmnet help page), models were fitted without providing a Î»-value, allowing the fit of many models over the regularisation path. For
prediction we used the optimal Î»-value estimated from cross-validation. The best-estimated values of Î± are shown in Supplementary material Appendix 1, Table A2. Lasso (Î± = 1) rather than ridge was chosen for almost half of the species in
environment-only and accessibility models. For the effort model, only three species had ridge models (Î± = 0) and all others had Î±-values 1. Maxent default settings were adapted according to advice in the literature (Merow et al. 2013,
Radosavljevic and Anderson 2014). Maxent, by default, uses combinations of feature classes (transformations of covariates: linear âLâ, quadratic âQâ, hinge âHâ, threshold âTâ, and product âPâ) depending on the number of presence locations
available, allowing for complex species-environment relationships (Phillips and DudÃ­k 2008). We adapted functions from the ENMeval package (Muscarella et al. 2014) to run Maxent models on cross-validation at different complexity levels and feature
class combinations (48 models = 8 regularisation multiplier values ranging from 0.5 to 4 with increment of 0.5 Ã 6 feature class combinations [L / LQ / H / LQH / LQHP / LQHPT]). The default number of background points used by Maxent (10,000) is
insufficient to represent the environmental variability in large study areas as used here (Renner and Warton 2013), and hence all potential grids were considered as background points. We used clamping while predicting to the left-out fold, meaning
that if any value of a covariate is beyond its training range, these values will be replaced by the closest value during training (Anderson and Raza 2010). For each species and bias manipulation, the combination of regularisation multiplier and
feature class that shows the highest mean testing-AUC (on cross-validation) were selected for predictions. The optimum combinations of Maxentâs feature classes and regularisation multiplier are shown in Supplementary material Appendix 1, Table A1.
The selected feature classes deviated from Maxentâs default: 10 species always had simple features (L/LQ) for all bias manipulations, with the effort model showing more complex features in some cases. Moreover, the best-estimated regularisation
multiplier also deviated from the default value of one, with many species having values &gt;1, indicating little overfitting. Model evaluation We evaluated the models using threshold-independent (the area under the ROC curve, AUC) and
threshold-dependent (True Skill Statistic, TSS) metrics. We tried to avoid some of the metrics&#39; known caveats through 1) the use of species-specific study areas; 2) block cross-validation minimising environmental extrapolation; and 3) using the
same blocking structure to run different modelling techniques and bias manipulations of the same species. In presence-only SDMs, presences comprise only a tiny fraction of the background. During evaluation, the use of too many background points
with equal weights for commission and omission error can distort the evaluation (Lobo et al. 2008). To be able to compare AUCs (computed using the dismo R package) among models for the same species, we set the numbers of test presences and random
test background (test data prevalence) to a ratio of 1:20, and repeated this 100 times to average stochastic effects. TSS was calculated using the threshold that maximises the sum of sensitivity and specificity (Liu et al. 2013), again using a
constant ratio of presences and background. AUC and TSS were calculated for each combination of species, algorithm and bias manipulation. We summarised the overall effect of different bias manipulations in two ways, using linear mixed-effect
models (R-package lme4; Bates et al. 2015). Firstly, to evaluate the effect of incorporating bias covariates into the model, we compared evaluation of the environment-only models (without any bias correction) to those of bias-accounted models
(accessibility and effort) without conditioning on a particular value of the bias covariate during prediction (modelling evaluation). Second, to explore the effect of bias correction on model evaluation, we performed similar comparisons, with
bias-free predictions of the bias-accounted models instead (bias correction evaluation; for details see Supplementary material Appendix 6). We expect models incorporating the impact of bias to outperform (signified by a higher AUC or TSS) those
that do not. The problem is that we do not have bias-free data, and therefore our test data exhibit the same bias as the data used to create the model. Under these circumstances, models allowing for bias may be worse than those that do not. In
either case, the difference between bias-corrected and control models is a measure of the impact of bias. In the mixed models, we used model evaluation as response variable, species as random effect, and model type, bias correction (and their
interactions), total number of training presences, and total number of pixels at per-species study area (range size) as fixed effects (for more details, see Supplementary material Appendix 6). Results Validation by block cross-validation vs. by
Egypt hold-out The overall mean AUC is 0.88 Â± 0.08 on cross-validation (0.75 Â± 0.13 in Egyptâs evaluation; Figs. 2-3). Because results for AUC and TSS were similar, we present only results for AUC (see Supplementary material Appendix 1, Fig. A11
and supplement for TSS). Model evaluations in Egypt were, on average, poorer than on cross-validation. However, both types of evaluation (using âbias-correctedâ predictions) show positive correlation (Kendallâs tau; n=21 â Supplementary material
Appendix 1, Fig. A7), with highest consistency for the accessibility model. As expected, species with fewer occupied cells tend to have higher evaluation variability (uncertainty), and hence provide less robust analyses (Supplementary material
Appendix 1, Figs. A9-10). Effect of bias corrections: mixed-effect model analysis across species and model types Sampling-bias model explained most of the variation in model validation, followed by the modelling algorithm, and their interaction
(Fig. 2 and Supplementary material Appendix 6.1). The total number of training presence (positive effect) and the range size (negative effect) were much less important. On average, the accessibility model performed much better than
environment-only and effort models (Figs. 2 and Supplementary material Appendix 6.1). For mean cross-validations, effort models also had relatively higher AUCs than the environment-only model (the difference is much smaller for elastic net and
GLM; Figs. 2a). However, for validation in Egypt, effort models were similar to the environment-only model (Figs. 2b , see also Supplementary material Appendix 6.1). We can also evaluate the performance of the sampling-bias models when their bias
covariates are set to a fixed value, i.e. when predicting to bias-free data. However, since we have no reference survey data to compare them to, these predictions reveal the impact of bias-correction on the model, rather than assess the modelâs
performance. These evaluations are presented in Fig. 3 and Supplementary material Appendix 6.2. Effect of model type The predictive performance of the three modelling algorithms showed fair to moderately high correlation coefficient (most r &gt; 0.6,
all significant; Fig. 4). For mean cross-validation evaluations, GLM performed best, followed by elastic net and Maxent. The order is reversed for independent validations in Egypt: Maxent has highest AUC-values, followed by elastic net, then GLM
(Figs. 2-4, and Supplementary material Appendix 6).â Discussion Sampling bias, if not corrected for effectively, can substantially affect the predicted intensity and model evaluation of SDMs. Our results suggest that accessibility bias covariates
describe the bias in our focal speciesâ training data well, compared to sampling efforts, and their use led to higher validation scores. Evaluated on data that are themselves spatially biased, we find that removing sampling bias did not improve
the predictive performance on cross-validation or in Egypt (Fig. 3), highlighting the limitation of evaluating bias correction without independent bias-free presence-absence data. Collectively, the three modelling algorithms performed similarly
well in cross-validation, though predicting to new sites (Egypt) gave Maxent a slight advantage (Figs. 2b and 3b). Sampling-bias correction using presence-only data Few approaches exist to correct for sampling bias, some not applicable when data
are sparse. Spatial filtering (i.e. aggregation to single records within some larger buffer: e.g. Anderson and Raza 2010, Boria et al. 2014) might be wasteful when only few presences exist. Removal of clumped data will reduce training sample size
and may remove some of the environmental conditions occupied by the species (depending on the heterogeneity of the landscape, selected distance, and pixel size). Target-group background selection strictly assumes that related species were
collected with the same method and equipment (Phillips et al. 2009), bias is similar across species (Warton et al. 2013), and species have the same chance of being recorded in all locations (Yackulic et al. 2013). Moreover, it replaces the
observer bias with a (spatial) species-richness bias and can be understood as modelling the likelihood of encountering the target species rather than a non-target species (Warton et al. 2013, Warren et al. 2014). Also, it does not distinguish
between areas unsuitable for any of the species and areas of low accessibility (no records, but potentially suitable: Warren et al. 2014, Fithian et al. 2015). The target-group background cannot be used when data on the related species are
similarly limited, as this increases the risk of extrapolating in environmental space (Mateo et al. 2010, Merow et al. 2013). Bias layers attempt to describe with which biases presence locations were recorded (Phillips et al. 2009, Warton et al.
2013). Our external sampling-effort model (Fig. 1 bottom right) is such an attempt to derive a bias layer (e.g. Elith et al. 2010). The bias layer is currently only implemented in Maxent, and we are not aware of any study that applied a similar
approach using other modeling algorithms. To maintain consistency of the analyses across different modelling algorithms we did not consider using a bias layer here. Both bias layer and target-group are used to sample background with the same bias
as presence locations, which is a sensitive tuning step that strongly influences model evaluation (Chefaoui and Lobo 2008). We think that model-based bias correction, as applied here, is more plausible in data deficient situations and if applied
efficiently, it frees us from artificially manipulating presences or background points, and rather focus on sampling bias correction. The effectiveness of bias correction depends on whether bias covariates are actually able to describe the bias in
the available data. Our use of either accessibility or sampling effort bias covariates did not lead to notably different conclusions (see Fig. 5). Using sampling-effort bias covariate led to, on average, little to moderate evaluation changes
(Figs. 2-3). It is in fact a model-based version of the target-group background approach, without strict selection of the background data points. The assumption that closely related species have similar bias may not hold. Surprisingly, most of the
available presences of our focal species were located in areas of low to moderate estimated efforts (Supplementary material Appendix 1, Fig. A13), but still strongly biased towards roads and cities (and, to less extent, protected areas;
Supplementary material Appendix 1, Fig. A13). Ideally, evaluating bias correction requires independent âbias-freeâ presence-absence testing data (Phillips et al. 2009). Such data are typically not available, especially in developing countries, and
removing bias from test data is very difficult (DudÃ­k et al. 2005, Smith 2013). On average, validation of bias-corrected predictions using well-structured, independent presence-absence data from rigorous surveys led to improved predictions (Elith
and Leathwick 2007, Phillips et al. 2009, Mateo et al. 2010, Syfert et al. 2013, Warton et al. 2013, Boria et al. 2014). However, this improvement is not happening in all situations and depends on the modelling conditions, species prevalence,
validity of assumptions, and how effective bias covariates are in describing bias in training presences (Phillips et al. 2009, Warton et al. 2013, Fourcade et al. 2014). As covariates that affect sampling may also affect the distribution of a
species (e.g. avoiding deserts), no method can fully correct for sampling bias in presence-only data without affecting the niche model (Merow et al. 2014, Guillera-Arroita et al. 2015). Correction of sampling bias leads to larger areas of suitable
habitats due to higher suitability estimates in low-accessible sites (e.g. Phillips et al. 2009, Warton et al. 2013; Fig. 5). Predictions at such sites are of lower reliability and should be interpreted with caution (Supplementary material
Appendix 1, Fig. A16 for an example). They can be used to guide future surveys and conservation planning, but not for taking serious conservation decisions (Guisan et al. 2006). Evaluations using spatial-block cross-validation vs. Egyptian
hold-out We used spatial-block cross-validation to avoid overestimating model performance and underestimating predictive errors (Bahn and McGill 2013, Renner et al. 2015, Roberts et al. 2017). Block cross-valuations suggested a better model
performance than evaluation on Egyptian data. This can be explained by differences in sample size and by environmental variability: on average, our cross-validation models had a larger mean number of testing presences and higher environmental
variability compared to evaluations at smaller scale (Table 1). However, evaluations at both scales were positively correlated, which supports the idea that evaluations on cross-validation (larger extent) can be indicative of performance at the
local scale. Evaluation metrics &amp; predictive performance Using AUC and TSS led to consistent conclusions. The overall evaluation scores are fair to high, taking into account that spatially independent evaluation yields lower scores compared to
commonly used random split (Radosavljevic and Anderson 2014). In presence-only SDMs, the use of a particular value for defining good models become unreliable (Yackulic et al. 2013), due to higher uncertainty of estimates at background points and
as the number of background points used is not fixed. In this study, we maintained constant test-data prevalence (1:20) across all comparisons, which gave very similar results, across all species, to the standard default approach of computing AUC
(see Supplementary material Appendix 1, Fig. A14). For some species, the spread over the 100 repetitions was very noticeable, however, making our approach somewhat more robust. The improved predictive performance reported by Syfert et al. (2013),
for example, may be in part attributable to much higher testing prevalence. Also in our study, the larger the number of available presences and the smaller the study area was, the higher were the predictions scores. Comparison of modelling
algorithms The three modelling algorithms applied did not lead to different conclusions and their evaluations were highly correlated. Elastic-net models showed intermediate performance in all situations. GLM (more specifically: the down-weighted
Poisson regression (DWPR) with variable selection) had the highest evaluation on cross-validation, which may suggest that GLM-DWPR is more powerful with a larger number of testing presences. However, GLMs predictions in Egypt were less nuanced
compared to other two modelling algorithms (Supplementary material Appendix 1, Fig. A15a, for example), which explains why it ranked lowest on the Egyptian hold-out. Maxent had the lowest prediction error on the Egyptian data, which suggests its
transferability to situations of low extrapolation. However, Maxent had the lowest evaluation on cross-validation, possibly due to clamping. We applied âclampingâ to constrain the response beyond the training range, which changes some of the
predicted values. Clamping can affect model evaluation (the ranking of the predicted values) and, while its effect has not been well-explored in the literature, it seems to depend on the shape of the response curve (at both ends), the importance
of the covariate, and how much environmental extrapolation occurs. We expect the effect of clamping to be small in the Egyptian hold-out compared to the cross-validation, due to less extrapolation. When correcting for bias, no interaction should
be allowed between bias and other covariates so that, for prediction, the bias can be corrected for without affecting the other covariates (Warton et al. 2013). For GLM and elastic net, we have full control of the modelsâ interactions. However,
the version of Maxent used here (3.3.3k) does not enable users to select which interactions to use, and the use of the product feature inevitably enables all pairwise interactions. In further applications, it may be recommended to disable the
âproductâ feature class while correcting for sampling bias. However, its use here did not lead to different conclusions compared to GLM and elastic net, suggesting that bias-suitability interactions were of limited importance. During the reviewing
of this manuscript, an open-source version of Maxent (maxnet R package: Phillips et al. 2017) was released that uses the glmnet package for L1-regularization. Maxnet provides flexibility for specifying the interactions to be used, so it is
possible to exclude interactions between environmental and bias variables (making them similar to our elastic-net models, but with more flexibility for other feature classes implemented in Maxent, e.g. the hinge). This early version of maxnet
implements an Infinitely-Weighted Logistic Regression (IWLR; Fithian and Hastie 2013) and only L1-regularization (lasso); however, further extensions are possible, e.g. the implementation of DWPR and elastic net (similar to our elastic-net
models). We implemented the down-weighted Poisson regression using both GLM and elastic net. As Poisson models, their predictions have no upper bound and may thus yield extreme predictions. We reported the existence of a few extreme predicted
intensities for many species, which makes it difficult to plot their predictions on a linear scale (see Fig. 5 and Supplementary material Appendix 1, Fig. A15b for an example). In contrast, Maxent puts a constraint on the moments of the
predictions, making them less subject to extreme values (Phillips et al. 2006). Conclusion Data-sparse regions pose challenges to modelling species distributions, exacerbated by noticeable sampling biases. We recommend the use of model-based bias
correction in data-sparse situations, in which other bias corrections methods are not possible; however, the effectiveness of bias correction depends on whether bias covariates are actually able to describe the bias in the available data. Using
covariates to describe site accessibility improved prediction to spatially independent hold-outs, compared to environment-only or effort models. Augmenting local records with data from across the speciesâ range allowed us to make consistently
high-quality predictions to hold-out data from an entire country (in this case Egypt). Bias-free predictions can enhance future conservation planning and target future surveys when limited resources are available to cover large study areas.
However, due to possible lower certainty at unsurveyed locations, they should be used cautiously (maps including bias are of use only during model cross-validation). Without survey-based presence-absence data, no complete evaluation of the quality
of bias corrections can be attempted. Down-weighted Poisson regression as well as the statistically equivalent Maxent approach led to similar results, with more flexibility in the elastic-net models (e.g. degree of shrinkage, question-led
specification of non-linear effects and interactions). More important than the specific algorithm is to use the point-process modelling framework as such. Acknowledgements We would like to express our sincere thanks for Petr Benda (Charles

Species distribution modeling (SDM) is an essential method in ecology and conservation. SDMs are often calibrated within one country&#39;s borders, typically along a limited environmental gradient with biased and incomplete data, making the quality of
these models questionable. In this study, we evaluated how adequate are national presence-only data for calibrating regional SDMs. We trained SDMs for Egyptian bat species at two different scales: only within Egypt and at a species-specific global
extent. We used two modeling algorithms: Maxent and elastic net, both under the point-process modeling framework. For each modeling algorithm, we measured the congruence of the predictions of global and regional models for Egypt, assuming that the
lower the congruence, the lower the appropriateness of the Egyptian dataset to describe the species&#39; niche. We inspected the effect of incorporating predictions from global models as additional predictor (âpriorâ) to regional models, and
quantified the improvement in terms of AUC and the congruence between regional models run with and without priors. Moreover, we analyzed predictive performance improvements after correction for sampling bias at both scales. On average, predictions
from global and regional models in Egypt only weakly concur. Collectively, the use of priors did not lead to much improvement: similar AUC and high congruence between regional models calibrated with and without priors. Correction for sampling bias
led to higher model performance, whatever prior used, making the use of priors less pronounced. Under biased and incomplete sampling, the use of global bats data did not improve regional model performance. Without enough bias-free regional data,
we cannot objectively identify the actual improvement of regional models after incorporating information from the global niche. However, we still believe in great potential for global model predictions to guide future surveys and improve regional
sampling in data-poor regions.&lt;br&gt;
Species distribution models (SDMs) are statistical methods that relate species information (either presence-only or presenceâabsence) to environmental variables to infer spatially explicit habitat suitability. They are being used intensively as a
standard tool for estimating potential range shifts under climate change, assessing invasion risk, locate future survey sites, and conservation planning and prioritization (AraÃºjo, Alagador, Cabeza, NoguÃ©s-Bravo, &amp; Thuiller, 2011; Guisan &amp;
Zimmermann, 2000; Guisan et al., 2013; RodrÃ­guez, Brotons, Bustamante, &amp; Seoane, 2007; Thuiller et al., 2005). Although these methods have limitations and uncertainties (AraÃºjo &amp; Guisan, 2006; Dormann, Purschke, MÃ¡rquez, Lautenbach, &amp; SchrÃ¶der,
2008; Guisan &amp; Thuiller, 2005), they constitute the best available tools when not much detailed information on the ecology and physiology of the species is available (Warren, Wright, Seifert, Shaffer, &amp; Franklin, 2014).&lt;br&gt;
In developing countries, the majority of species sightings are scattered, opportunistic, and recorded mainly in museum catalogues, personal collections, and the literature. Due to political instability and limited funds dedicated to wildlife
conservation (amongst other reasons), there is no systematic nation-wide sampling scheme for collecting biological information in most developing countries. Many of these countries do not share their biodiversity data, making them highly
under-represented at international data depositories, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), with many more records from countries with high GDP (Newbold, 2010). Furthermore, data from developing countries are particularly
(but not exclusively) spatially biased (more records from accessible locations near roads and cities) and taxonomically biased (toward larger or charismatic species). Spatial bias poses a problem for SDMs, which, in their default approach, assume
that available presence locations represent a random (representative) sample in the environmental/geographical space, with no spatial dependencies (Elith et al., 2011; Renner et al., 2015). This assumption is hardly ever met due to sampling bias,
imperfect detectability and spatial auto-correlation (Guillera-Arroita et al., 2015). When high sampling bias exists, SDM predictions provide an estimate not necessarily of the species suitability, but more of the patterns of the sampling effort
and detectability (Elith et al., 2011; Yackulic et al., 2013). Several methods have been proposed to correct for sampling bias (e.g., target-group background: Phillips et al., 2009; spatial filtering: Anderson &amp; Raza, 2010; sampling bias
predictors: Warton, Renner, &amp; Ramp, 2013); however, no method seems to be able to fully correct for sampling bias in presence-only data (El-Gabbas &amp; Dormann, 2017; Merow et al., 2014).&lt;br&gt;
One of the major challenges of SDM studies is how to determine the extent of the study area appropriately. Study area should be objectively determined to cover accessible areas by the species within its known complete range, allowing for wider
range of environmental variation and extremes occupied by the species (Barve et al., 2011; Raes, 2012; SÃ¡nchez-FernÃ¡ndez, Lobo, &amp; HernÃ¡ndez-Manrique, 2011). However, it is common that study areas are unjustifiably determined based on geographical
or political borders for regional/local conservation actions, resulting in models calibrated with a limited range of environmental conditions that do not capture much of the species&#39; niche and hence is insufficient to describe its environmental
tolerance (Raes, 2012; Titeux et al., 2017). This leads to the truncation of the estimated response curves, underrepresentation of areas of suitable habitats, and limiting the predictive power of the models (SÃ¡nchez-FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2011;
Thuiller, Brotons, AraÃºjo, &amp; Lavorel, 2004). This is more problematic when the aim of the study is to extrapolate beyond the training range, either in time or space (Barbet-Massin, Thuiller, &amp; Jiguet, 2010; Thuiller et al., 2004), or in situations
where available data are few, opportunistic, or with high (typically unknown) sampling bias. The paucity of available records in developing countries, coupled with clear signs of sampling bias and limited local environmental gradients, makes it
challenging to establish robust SDMs for a variety of taxonomic groups at the national scale.&lt;br&gt;
In this article, we evaluate the adequacy of regional presence-only data (in this case from within a developing country&#39;s political borders) for constructing SDMs. More specifically, we compare bat occurrence predictions from regional and global
SDMs for the country of Egypt, in many respects exemplary for developing countries. Egypt shows much lower environmental variability compared to the global extents of the species (see Figures 1 and S1) and comprises only a small proportion of
available global records. This makes the quality of regional SDMs, that is, those built only on the sparse Egyptian data, questionable. Global models (at species-specific global range) should in this case be more reliable than regional models (in
Egypt) in describing the climatic niche of species because they are calibrated with a much higher number of presences and capture a much wider range of occupied (or, more generally, accessible) environmental conditions (Pearson, Dawson, &amp; Liu,
2004). Thus, we evaluate predictions from regional and global SDMs for Egypt, arguing that the less similar they are, the more the local data describe sampling effort rather than the ecology of bats. Furthermore, we investigate how much correction
for sampling bias (using bias predictors, in both regional and global SDMs) helps to improve the local predictions for Egypt.&lt;br&gt;
Predictions from global models interpolated to Egypt represent a spatial-explicit information on the species potential distribution that is independent from regional data available from Egypt, and thus can be useful to improve predictions of
regional models when used as additional predictors (cf. âinformative offsetâ: Merow, Allen, Aiello-Lammens, &amp; Silander, 2016). We explore how much global predictions (interpolated to Egypt) improve Egyptian regional models when used as predictor
âpriorâ to describe the environmental niche (again, with and without correcting for sampling bias).&lt;br&gt;
Study design and species&lt;br&gt;
This study builds on a comparison of methods to correct for sampling biases (El-Gabbas &amp; Dormann, 2017), adding an evaluation of regional species distribution models based on national records. We collected records for Egyptian bat species (from
within Egypt and their global extents) from different sources (Appendix S1 and El-Gabbas &amp; Dormann, 2017). Four species with fewer than eight unique sightings in Egypt were excluded from the analyses, yielding a total of 17 species (Table S1). For
the selected species, we created regional models using presence locations and environmental data only for Egypt (âregional SDMsâ). âRegionalâ refers here to a geographic extent much smaller than the range of the species, but of much coarser grain
than a local dataset. We also created analogous models across the global range (âglobal SDMsâ): These models were made for each species-specific global extent (a buffered bounding box around all global records), excluding Egyptian records to
maintain independence (and to allow for valid comparisons) between the predictions of the regional and global models (see below; and El-Gabbas &amp; Dormann, 2017 for details). Both scales are nested in geographical and environmental space: Our
regional models are calibrated within a subset of each species-specific global extent. At either scale, we used two modeling algorithms under the point-process modeling framework (Maxent and elastic net; Renner et al., 2015), with two options on
dealing with sampling bias (with and without bias correction), and evaluated the results using spatial-block cross-validation (Roberts et al., 2017).&lt;br&gt;
Environmental variables&lt;br&gt;
Potential environmental predictors (at the total study area covering both scales) and species records were projected into Mollweide equal-area projection at a resolution of 5 Ã 5 km2. Using the same pixel size and projection maintains consistency
of the analyses between regional and global models (Budic, Didenko, &amp; Dormann, 2016). As the correlation between predictors varies from one study area to another, different environmental predictor combinations were used at regional and global
scales. Some predictors were not useful at the regional scale, and hence were excluded a priori; for example, precipitation of driest month does not show any variability across Egypt because most of Egypt receives no precipitation at all in
summer, reflecting its hyper-arid climate (El-Gabbas, Baha El Din, Zalat, &amp; Gilbert, 2016). We ensured minimum multi-collinearity at both scales by selecting only predictors that maintain a maximum generalized variance inflation factor value less
than 3 (see Table S2 for the list of predictors used at either scale).&lt;br&gt;
Modeling algorithms&lt;br&gt;
We used two modeling algorithms: Maxent and elastic net. Maxent (Phillips &amp; DudÃ­k, 2008; v3.3.3k) is a machine-learning presence-background SDM algorithm. It outperforms other presence-only SDM algorithms, especially at smaller sample sizes (e.g.,
Wisz et al., 2008), due to its use of (some form of) lasso regularization. Elastic net (Friedman, Hastie, &amp; Tibshiani, 2010) is an extension of GLMs that uses âlassoâ and âridgeâ regularization rather than AIC to select the most suitable model,
and hence is similarly resistant to overfitting. We applied both algorithms under the point-process modeling framework following recommendations of Renner et al. (2015), changing some of Maxent&#39;s default settings (e.g., to ânoautofeature,â
ânoaddsamplestobackground,â and ânoremoveduplicatesâ), and used the implementation of âdown-weighted Poisson regressionâ for elastic-net models. For each calibrated model of either algorithm, we adjusted against unnecessary complexity (Merow et
al., 2014) using five-fold spatial-block cross-validation, estimating the best combination of Maxent&#39;s feature classes and regularization multiplier based on maximizing the mean testing AUC (Muscarella et al., 2014), and the optimum Î± (which
describes the balance between ridge and lasso) for elastic net.&lt;br&gt;
Adjusting for sampling bias&lt;br&gt;
In addition to âenvironment-onlyâ models (without bias correction), we use two different methods of predicting from models that incorporate bias: âbias-predictorâ and âbias-corrected.â In both methods, we use sampling bias predictors as our
estimate of bias: three layers describing distances to main roads, cities, and protected areas (Warton et al., 2013). Bias-predictor models use the bias layers simply as an extra set of predictors, and during prediction also their values change.
Bias-corrected models try to factor out the bias by setting the bias variables to zero (see Warton et al., 2013). The three options for sampling bias (none, predictor, and correction) were applied to regional and global models, with bias
predictors nested for regional scale within the global scale.&lt;br&gt;
Model evaluation and the use of spatial priors&lt;br&gt;
We evaluated regional model performance using AUC as a threshold-independent metric. Despite the criticism of the use of AUC to evaluate the performance of presence-only SDMs (e.g., Lobo, JimÃ©nez-Valverde, &amp; Real, 2008), our use of AUC for
comparisons between models of the same species, predictors, and study area is valid (Anderson &amp; Gonzalez, 2011; Wisz et al., 2008). We did not use AUC to quantify model performance (goodness of fit), but rather as a measure of the relative ranking
of predictions at testing presence and background locations. We calculated AUC on five-fold spatial-block cross-validation to maintain spatial independence between training and testing data (Fithian, Elith, Hastie, Keith, &amp; O&#39;Hara, 2015; Roberts
et al., 2017): The same blocking structure (how spatial blocks are distributed into cross-validation folds) is used for each species, with balanced prevalence among blocks and same block sizes, allowing for valid AUC comparisons for the same
species. The mean value of testing AUC on cross-validation is reported.&lt;br&gt;
To quantify the efficacy of Egyptian data to construct SDMs, we calculated the geographical congruence (Schoener&#39;s D; Schoener, 1968; Warren, Glor, &amp; Turelli, 2010) between continuous predictions of the global and regional SDMs for Egypt (scaled
to sum to one; without and with bias correction). Our assumption is that the higher the geographical congruence, the more suitable the Egyptian records are to parameterize regional models. When assessing the congruence between maps we used all
three bias options, while for regional comparisons based on AUC we only used the first two models (environment-only and bias-predictor), due to the lack of bias-free testing-data from Egypt required to evaluate bias-corrected predictions.
Geographical congruence and AUC gave similar results, indicating that geographical congruence indeed measured how similarly well, not how similarly poorly models predicted.&lt;br&gt;
We then measured the improvement of regional SDMs after incorporating a spatial-explicit information on the global climatic niche. More specifically, for each species we used predictions from the global SDM interpolated to Egypt (i.e., not using
the Egyptian data, and thus referred to hereafter as âpriorâ) as an additional predictor to create a new set of regional models. We had three types of priors representing the predictions of global models for Egypt: 1) from the environment-only
model, âPriorenv-onlyâ; 2) a prediction incorporating the bias layer as a predictor to adjust for sampling bias, âPriorbias-predictedâ; and 3) a prediction from a model that has factored out bias, âPriorbias-correctedâ. Modeling algorithms were
not mixed, that is, global models from Maxent were used only for regional models with Maxent, and analogously for elastic-net models. We quantified the improvement due to priors in two ways. First, we measured changes in model performance (AUC).
Secondly, we calculated the map congruence between regional models&#39; predictions in Egypt with and without incorporating priors: the higher the map congruence, the lower the contribution of the prior to the regional SDM. One-tailed paired t-test
(df = 16) was used for comparisons between each pair of modeling algorithms, sampling bias options, and changes in AUC and map congruence.&lt;br&gt;
The relative importance of environmental variables (permutation importance calculated by Maxent) varied at global and regional scales. When incorporated, the accessibility bias predictors at both scales had high Maxent permutation importance
(particularly, âdistance to citiesâ was of significantly higher importance than all but one variable [p .05; nonsignificant only for Bio4 at global scale and Bio6 at regional scale], and âdistance to roadsâ which had a significantly higher average
importance than three different environmental variables at either scales; Figure 2). Furthermore, the response of species to environmental predictors was, unsurprisingly, different at both scales. For example, for Eptesicus bottae at the global
scale, the response to precipitation of the coldest quarter increased sharply at low precipitation values (approx. 0â130 mm), then remained high or decayed depending on whether the global bias predictors were used or not, respectively (Figure
S2a). At the regional scale, however, the species response was highest at extremely low precipitation values (around 10 mm), then declined sharply (Figure S2c).&lt;br&gt;
Global versus regional SDMs&lt;br&gt;
Different areas were identified as suitable in models either using data from the full range or just from Egypt, with low geographic congruence between the predictions of global and regional models for Egypt (Figure 3). The incorporation of bias
predictors (at both scales) did not lead to substantial congruence improvement (yet statistically significant; all p .01). The congruence was highest when bias-corrected models were used (statistically higher than environment-only and
bias-predicted models for Maxent and elastic net, p .001). Maxent and elastic net yielded similar values for congruence, with an advantage of Maxent for bias-predictor models (p .05).&lt;br&gt;
The use of prior information from the entire range&lt;br&gt;
The use of priors did not lead to AUC improvement, except when using Priorbias-predictor (p .05; Figure 4a). Results were similar for both Maxent and elastic net, with higher AUC values for Maxent (all p .01). Maxent showed relatively low
permutation importance of the different prior variables, except for Priorbias-predictor which had high contributions to the models (all p .0001, although also with high variability; Figure S3, left panel).&lt;br&gt;
The incorporation of prior variables as predictors yielded high geographical congruence between the predictions of regional models without and with priors (Figure 5). However, the congruence values depended on the prior used. The use of
Priorenv-only or Priorbias-corrected led to high congruence, indicating little additional information provided by the priors. In contrast, when Priorbias-predictor was used, geographical congruence was less pronounced (p .001), suggesting that
here information different from the regional data entered the model. Both Maxent and elastic net produced similar values for congruence, with slightly higher values for elastic net when Priorbias-predictor was used (marginally significant; p =
.042).&lt;br&gt;
Correction of regional sampling bias&lt;br&gt;
When regional bias predictors were incorporated into the SDMs, the regional models performed better (higher AUC; all p .05), leading to a negligible effect of priors (Figure 4b). Maxent has relatively higher AUC scores than elastic net (all p
.01). However, Priorbias-predictor showed equivalently high AUC values whether or not regional bias predictors were included (p &gt; .7; see Figure 4a,b for a comparison). This was also evident by the much lower permutation importance of prior
predictors when regional bias predictors were incorporated, with relatively higher importance for Priorbias-predictor (all p .05; Figure S3, right panel).&lt;br&gt;
Incorporating regional bias predictors led to similar patterns of congruence (between predictions of regional SDMs created with or without priors) to those which did not incorporate bias (Figure 5 vs. Figure S4, light gray boxes), with relatively
lower congruence when Priorbias-predictor was used. However, bias-correction (factoring out the bias) did not affect congruence for Maxent, while much lower congruence values were observed for elastic net whichever priors were used (Figure S4,
dark gray boxes). In other words, regional bias correction led to less agreement between regional model predictions (with and without priors) for elastic net, regardless of which prior variables were used.&lt;br&gt;
In this study, we evaluated how much improvement to the regional SDMs for Egypt occurs by incorporating additional information (the âpriorsâ) representing the global climatic niche from outside Egypt. First, without providing information on
regional bias (no regional bias correction), Priorenv-only and Priorbias-corrected did not lead to improvements in the regional models: Similar AUC values (Figure 4a) and high geographical congruence (Figure 5) imply that they do not provide new
information to the regional models. However, the use of Priorbias-predictor led on average to higher AUC and lower geographical congruence, signaling that new information was provided to the models. This was supported in Maxent models by the
higher permutation importance of Priorbias-predictor, compared to the other two options of priors (Figure S3, left panel). On the other hand, when regional bias predictors were incorporated, all models had improved AUC, whether or not priors were
used (Figure 4b). Regional bias predictors describe the local bias existing in the Egyptian dataset, and their use led to higher AUC, in accordance with other studies (El-Gabbas &amp; Dormann, 2017; Warton et al., 2013). The use of regional bias
predictors makes the contribution of priors negligible: Priorenv-only and Priorbias-corrected had an extremely low contribution to these models, only slightly higher for Priorbias-predictor (Figure S3, right panel). Generally, Maxent and elastic
net led to very similar results, with slightly higher discrimination ability for Maxent.&lt;br&gt;
Priorbias-predictor implicitly contains information on the regional bias of the records in Egypt, because it represents predictions of equivalent global models calibrated with accessibility bias variables (regional bias variables represent a
narrower range than their equivalent variables at global scale). In contrast to bias-free predictions, the use of bias variables as predictors gives higher predicted suitabilities at locations of high accessibility (e.g., closer to roads and
cities), which is the reason for high AUC scores when evaluation datasets are similarly biased (Warton et al., 2013). The available dataset for Egyptian bats is spatially-biased, with more records collected near roads and cities (El-Gabbas &amp;
Dormann, 2017), and hence Priorbias-predictor describes the available data better than the other two priors. The relatively modest contribution of Priorbias-predictor, and even lower contribution of the other two priors, can be understood as the
result of the unavailability of complete, bias-free data from Egypt (see below). Furthermore, Priorenv-only and Priorbias-corrected are highly correlated with some other environmental variables in Egypt (higher than for Priorbias-predictor),
particularly for Bio19 (precipitation of coldest quarter) and Bio9 (mean temperature of driest quarter; Figure S5), and hence to a large extent provide redundant information.&lt;br&gt;
The three prior suitabilities show low geographical congruence with their corresponding regional predictions in Egypt (Figures 3 and S6, e.g., maps), meaning they (global models) identify different sites as suitable than do models based on
Egyptian records. This can be explained by factors related to model misspecification (e.g., the variables used and violation of model assumptions), the difficulty of modeling widespread species with high accuracy (Stockwell &amp; Peterson, 2002), the
low quality of available data, or species-specific reasons (e.g., species plasticity and the existence of ecotypes; Randin et al., 2006). We exclude environmental extrapolation as a reason for the on average low performance of the predictions of
the global model for Egypt, as we included environmental data for the area of Egypt in these models (but not the records), and hence, the predictions are not outside the realm of the global model (and hence do not represent an extrapolation).&lt;br&gt;
While it is advisable to check for collinearity at training and prediction scales (Elith, Kearney, &amp; Phillips, 2010), it is not always easy to maintain a representative set of variables that are uncorrelated at both scales. Although we minimized
the correlation between environmental variables at global and regional scales to avoid unnecessarily high variance in model parameters, the correlation among environmental variables is, inevitably, not constant over space (Dormann et al., 2013).
Some of the variables used at the global scale have high correlation in Egypt, making the reliability of predictions in Egypt less stable (Dormann et al., 2013; Elith et al., 2010). Furthermore, the quality of environmental variables is not
constant in space. For example, the WorldClim data (Hijmans, Cameron, Parra, Jones, &amp; Jarvis, 2005; the source of most of the environmental variables used in this study) were adroitly prepared using interpolation of data from global weather
stations. Weather stations are not evenly distributed in space: Climate data for areas such as Arabia and the Sahara (including Egypt) are interpolated using very few weather stations with high spatial clustering (see figure 1 in Hijmans et al.,
2005), and hence, the interpolations are of potentially higher uncertainty that can affect the quality of calibrated models (Phillips, Anderson, &amp; Schapire, 2006). This problem is not exclusive to the WorldClim data, but holds for any
environmental layers derived from spatially-biased weather stations.&lt;br&gt;
The environmental variables used may have been insufficient to characterize the species niche (Phillips et al., 2006). It is recommended to use proximal predictors (e.g., food sources or suitable roosting sites for bats) that directly describe the
required resources and physiological limits than more indirect distal predictors (e.g., altitude; Austin, 2007; Merow et al., 2014). The use of proximal variables increases the transferability of models in space (Elith &amp; Leathwick, 2009; Franklin,
2009). However, determining a set of species-specific proximal predictors is not possible without detailed knowledge of the ecology and physiology of each species, either unknown for most species (especially for bats) or not yet available at large
scales (e.g., abundance of prey; Merow et al., 2014; Herkt, Matthias, Barnikel, Skidmore, &amp; Fahr, 2016; Petitpierre, Broennimann, Kueffer, Daehler, &amp; Guisan, 2017). The majority of SDM studies use (the easier to obtain) distal variables as
surrogates for proximal variables; however, even if distal variables can indirectly describe the species requirements, the correlation between proximal and distal variables is not constant in space (Dormann et al., 2013; Elith &amp; Leathwick, 2009;
Merow et al., 2014). Examples of missed variables which can potentially improve model transferability for bats include locations of suitable roosting and foraging sites, proximity to water, food sources (Herkt et al., 2016; Razgour, Rebelo, Di
Febbraro, &amp; Russo, 2016). Regional models were calibrated for a limited environmental range (Figure S1), potentially contributing to the disagreement between regional and global model predictions.&lt;br&gt;
While excessive model complexity can lead to overfitting to training data and consequent limited model transferability in space and time, we reject overfitting as a reason for the limited usefulness of priors. We limited overfitting using
regularized modeling approaches, calibrated by spatial cross-validation blocks in a way that balances the number of presence locations and environmental variability between cross-validation folds (avoiding extrapolation) and adequately constrains
the complexity of (both regional and global) models. That said, it is not clear how much model complexity optimization is affected by the limited number and quality of records (including sampling bias).&lt;br&gt;
Predictions from global models interpolated to Egypt may well still describe the potential distribution of bats in Egypt. Their limited usefulness in our study only shows that the global dimension did not add new information, given the limitations
of the available data from Egypt. If unbiased occurrence data were available, global models may indeed predict well in Egypt. Moreover, available bat records in Egypt are few and spatially-biased toward easily accessible areas, with the majority
collected from relatively old literature and museum specimens. Most are opportunistic data gathered with an unknown sampling strategy (see Appendix S1). Due to their nocturnal and elusive behaviour, high maneuverability, and the need for
specialized bat detectors for effective recording, it is challenging to obtain high-quality records for bats in developing countries (Razgour et al., 2016). Information on their geographical distribution is very limited, making bats highly
under-represented in SDM studies (Herkt et al., 2016; Razgour et al., 2016), and Egypt is no exception. Finally, sampling bias can strongly affect model quality (Phillips et al., 2009), and while we attempted to correct for sampling bias in our
models, we cannot quantify the efficiency of bias correction without bias-free data for comparison (Phillips et al., 2009; Warton et al., 2013), unavailable in most presence-only studies, especially in developing countries. The results of this
study call for improved, systematic sampling of species occurrences in regions where currently only biased and scarce data are available.&lt;br&gt;
We have shown that the use of global bat data did not improve regional model performance for Egypt. We relate this to the difficulty of calibrating SDMs of widespread species at extremely large study areas that cover many biogeographical regions
and to data quality issues (mainly the quantity of available data dominated by high sampling bias). Due to the lack of high-quality data and limited environmental gradients in Egypt, regional SDMs seem to be insufficient to determine new survey
sites (a point also made by SÃ¡nchez-FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2011). Improving the sampling of fauna and flora species from data-poor countries (such as Egypt, particularly from the less visited areas) would enhance regional SDMs in these countries and
consolidate the usefulness of these models to discover new populations.&lt;br&gt;
Although our results showed that predictions from global SDMs failed to improve regional predictions calibrated with low-quality and spatially-biased data, we still believe in great potential for SDMs that integrates global and regional data to
improve future local sampling in data-poor countries like Egypt. Patterns of potential distribution (of global models interpolated to Egypt) can guide future surveys and help to discover new populations. In our analyses, we excluded Egyptian data
for creating the global models to maintain consistency of comparisons between predictions of regional and global models. However, this is not necessary for real applications, and it would seem preferable to include regional data in a comprehensive
model that covers the biogeographical region to improve model predictability. For example, to improve sampling of under-reported bat species in Egypt, we think that a larger-scale model should be created, with the study area determined objectively
based on the available data from Egypt and adjacent arid areas (e.g., Arabia and the Sahara) in order to meet the stationarity assumption (constant speciesâenvironment relationships with no change in niche characteristics; Anderson &amp; Gonzalez,
2011; Dormann et al., 2012) and then crop the prediction maps to Egypt. This is of mutual benefit not only for Egypt, but also for targetting efforts in the adjacent areas as well, which can help to improve the conservation status of some species.
However, obtaining enough data from adjacent areas will remain challenging for many species.&lt;br&gt;

Conserving Egyptâs reptiles under climate change&lt;br&gt;
Journal of Arid Environments, 127:211â221&lt;br&gt;
10.1016/j.jaridenv.2015.12.007&lt;br&gt;
Climate change has caused range shifts and extinctions of many species in the recent past. In this study, the effects of climate change on Egyptian reptiles were investigated for the first time using species distribution models. Maxent was used to
model the current and future distributions of suitable habitats for 75 terrestrial reptile species from Egypt. The modelled distribution for current suitable conditions for each species was projected into the future at three time slices using two
emission scenarios from four global circulation models and under two assumptions of dispersal ability. Climate change is expected to vary in its effects spatially, with some areas characterized by increased species richness while others show
declines. Future range changes vary among species and different future projections, from the entire loss to large gains in range. Two species were expected to become extinct in at least one future projection, and eight species were expected to
lose &amp;gt;80% of their current distribution. Although Protected Areas have greater conservation value, on average, compared to unprotected areas, they appear inadequate to conserve Egyptian reptiles under expected climate change. &lt;br&gt;
Over the last century, relatively rapid changes of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate have been recorded with warmer temperatures accompanied by altered geographical and seasonal distributions of precipitation (AraÃºjo and Rahbek, 2006; Thuiller, 2007). There is
widespread agreement that climate change will have a large impact on the survival of populations, species and communities (Suarez and Tsutsui, 2004), and that biodiversity is continually being transformed in response to it (Hannah et al., 2005).
Over the last 40 years climate change has been implicated as the main cause for distributional shifts and extinctions (Thomas et al., 2004), with a particularly strong impact on butterflies, birds and species at high altitude (Hannah, 2011).
Although the recorded effects of climate change on biodiversity seem in general to materialize rather slowly, its effects are expected to become increasingly prominent over the next 50 years and beyond (Thuiller, 2007). Some climate change model
forecasts suggest that 15â37% of current species will be committed to extinction by 2050 (even without taking into consideration the biological factors of competition and evolutionary history) (Thuiller, 2007), making it essential to involve
measures for mitigating its potential impacts in future conservation plans. &lt;br&gt;
Detailed information on the ecological and geographical distributions of species is essential for conservation planning and forecasting (Elith et al., 2006) especially where species face multiple conservation problems. Species Distribution Models
(SDMs) quantify the relationship between species&amp;rsquo; occurrence and environmental variables and allow users to extrapolate this relationship to new areas or time periods. SDMs have been widely used to estimate the potential impacts of climate change
on species distributions and ecosystems (Franklin, 2009) and estimate potential future extinction risks. Once a model has been calibrated for current climate conditions, it can be used to estimate potential distributions at different time periods
(in the future or the past) by using information on expected climates, or to different study areas in order to assess the potential locations where invasions are more likely to establish (Franklin, 2009). This helps to manage species facing
possible future threats by identifying biological corridors for dispersal, determining sites for re-introduction and areas require more protection measures (Thuiller, 2007). &lt;br&gt;
Climate change will potentially affect the biodiversity and species composition of Egyptian ecosystems (Tolba and Saab, 2009), but only a handful of quantitative studies of the local fauna/flora have been conducted using SDMs. This may be because
the models are relatively new and because until very recently reliable comprehensive biodiversity records for the Egyptian fauna and flora were not available. As a developing country, Egypt lacks a recording scheme to collate species sightings
(either at national or even at local Protected Area level). Between 2004 and 2008, all available biodiversity records were collated by the BioMAP project (see: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biomapegypt.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.biomapegypt.org/&lt;/a&gt;), and studies of butterflies and mammals using SDMs became
possible (Gilbert and Zalat, 2008; Basuony et al., 2010; Newbold, 2009; Newbold et al., 2009a,b). A few other SDM studies have been published: El Alqamy et al. (2010), to estimate the potential distribution of the Nubian Ibex (Capra nubiana) in
South Sinai; Soultan (2011), to test the potential impact of climate change on the distribution of four Egyptian antelope species; and Leach et al. (2013), who assessed the effect of climate change on the future effectiveness of the Protected Area
network, using data on Egyptian butterflies and mammals. The only other study of the effects of climate change in Egypt, by Hoyle and James (2005) on the world&amp;rsquo;s smallest butterfly, the Sinai Baton Blue (Pseudophilotes sinaicus), used an
occupancy-based Population Viability Analysis. &lt;br&gt;
The global current Protected Areas seem not to overlap well with areas of high biodiversity value, and are traditionally determined spatially and environmentally under the assumption of relatively low changes in species distribution in the future
(AraÃºjo, 2009; Leach et al., 2013). As climate change is expected to affect the future distribution/range of many species globally (potentially moving some species out from Protected Areas; Hannah et al. 2007), it challenges the future
effectiveness of current Protected Areas. Future conservation investments should be effectively prioritized due to the limited resources available (Wilson et al., 2009; especially in the developing countries), and early actions may be more
effective and less costly than delayed or no actions (Hannah et al. 2007). Conservation prioritization can be at taxonomic (for the protection of some rare or endangered species) or spatial (conserving a particular habitat type or species rich
areas, e.g. potential Protected Areas) scale. Spatial conservation prioritization uses spatial quantitative data to identify areas of high conservation priority (Wilson et al., 2009), and some techniques have been available recently; e.g. Zonation
(Moilanen et al., 2012) and Marxan (Ball et al., 2009). Some of those techniques can use spatial outputs from SDMs to prioritize areas for conservation under current and future climates. &lt;br&gt;
To date, there are 30 Protected Areas in Egypt covering &amp;gt;15% of its total area. Their distribution shows good spatial coverage, although some areas of high diversity importance (especially at the Nile Valley and Delta) are not yet protected
(Newbold et al., 2009a). They were declared relatively recently (first in 1983) and were determined mainly based on experts&amp;rsquo; known knowledge of the country biodiversity (Newbold et al., 2009a). The capacity of current Protected Areas in Egypt to
mitigate for potential impacts of climate change on different species groups is not well-investigated yet and a qualitative assessment of their future effectiveness is highly required. Also, spatial prioritization of the Egypt&amp;rsquo;s landscape (inside
and outside the Protected Areas) is required to identify potential locations for future Protected Areas and identify current Protected Areas need more conservation effort in the future. &lt;br&gt;
As a developing country, Egypt lacks enough good-quality data to be used directly for spatial conservation prioritization, but SDMs can provide valuable estimates for species suitabilities in the space. In this study, we use data for the Egyptian
reptiles, for the first time, to run SDMs (as a representation group for the Egyptian fauna). Baha El Din (2001, 2006) presented a geographic interpretation of Egypt&amp;rsquo;s herpetofaunal distribution, qualitatively identifying priority conservation
areas, but very little has been published on how the Egyptian herpetofauna may respond to climate change. We used Maxent to model the distribution of Egyptian reptiles under current climate conditions, then models are projected into the future to
show how collectively and individual species are expected to respond to future climate change under different assumptions. For each species, future expected range change (% loss or gain of currently suitable habitats) is estimated, aiming to shed
light on some species require more strict conservation actions. Expected reptiles&amp;rsquo; species richness (under current and future climates) is estimated to identify areas of current high reptile suitability and areas expected to undergo much changes
in suitability in the future. Model predictions were used for prioritizing the Egyptian landscape under current and future climates. We used Zonation software (Moilanen et al., 2012) to assess the likely effectiveness of Egypt&amp;rsquo;s Protected Area
network under current and future climate. Outputs from Zonation represent hierarchic ranking of the landscape for conservation and can be easily visualized as maps. We hope the results of the current study to be useful for biodiversity
conservation in Egypt and (along with the results of relative studies) to be taken into account by the decision makers in future national conservation plans. &lt;br&gt;
Study area and presence records &lt;br&gt;
According to Baha El Din (2006), Egypt has at least 109 species of reptiles: 61 lizards, 39 snakes, a crocodile, seven turtles and a tortoise, and Acanthodactylus aegyptius has been added as a distinct species since (Baha El Din, 2007). The main
source of species location records was the BioMAP (www.biomapegypt.org) database of Egyptian biodiversity records; with our own records, the data are comprehensive for the herpetofauna. Records for marine or aquatic species from the Nile were
excluded because of the lack of GIS predictor layers for aquatic environments. &lt;br&gt;
The taxonomic and georeferencing accuracy of these records were exhaustively checked, assessed and revised. We limited our scope to species with at least eight unique pixels (at a resolution of 2.5 arc minutes) to avoid over-fitting (Baldwin,
2009): this meant that a total of 75 species were processed (49 lizards, 25 snakes, and a tortoise: Table S1). The coverage of the records is good (Fig. S1a); they include most of Egypt&amp;rsquo;s landscape and habitats. There was an inevitable bias in
recording effort (represented by the number of valid records) towards the main cities and populated areas (Fig. S1b): unsurprisingly, the highest collection effort was found around the greater Cairo district, followed by South Sinai (the St
Katherine area), the Alexandria area, some areas around Fayoum and Wadi El-Natrun and small patches near El-Arish and Mersa Matruh. (Figs. S2âS3 show a map of Egypt overlaid with geographical locations of areas mentioned in this study and the
locations of currently established Protected Areas, respectively). &lt;br&gt;
Environmental predictor variables &lt;br&gt;
Climate data for the near past (1950â2000) were downloaded from WorldClim Global Climate Data v1.4 (release 3 â see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldclim.org/bioclim&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.worldclim.org/bioclim&lt;/a&gt;) (Hijmans et al., 2005). These data represent current climate conditions and comprise 19
âbioclimaticâ variables derived from precipitation and temperature records (Table 1). Four (Bio-7, -14, -17 &amp;amp; -18) were rejected a priori as not sufficiently variable across Egypt, reflecting the country&amp;rsquo;s status as the driest country in the world
(FAO, 2012). A resolution of 2.5 arc-minutes (â¼5 Ã 5 km) best matched the level of positional uncertainty that accompanies the records (most of which derive from museum records georeferenced by site name), and because the climate data for Egypt
were interpolated using relatively few weather stations largely concentrated in the Nile Valley and Delta (see Fig. 2.3 in Newbold, 2009). This relatively coarse resolution is also useful to minimise the effect of ignoring species interactions on
modelled distributions (Pearson and Dawson, 2003). &lt;br&gt;

Elevation data were obtained from the SRTM Digital Elevation Database v4.1 [available at: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cgiar-csi.org/data/elevation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.cgiar-csi.org/data/elevation&lt;/a&gt;]. The tiles that cover Egypt were downloaded at 90-m resolution and rescaled to 2.5 arc minutes. We also used an
Egyptian habitat map from the BioMAP project (A. A. Hassan, unpublished data). In this map, the habitat of Egypt is classified into 11 classes (sea, littoral coastal land, cultivated land, sand dune, wadi, metamorphic rock, igneous rock, gravels,
serir sand sheets, sabkhas and sedimentary rocks â see: Newbold et al., 2009a). Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data for seven years (from Jan 2004 to Dec 2010) were downloaded from the SPOT Vegetation website (see:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://free.vgt.vito.be/)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://free.vgt.vito.be/)&lt;/a&gt;. Two layers were derived from these maps and used as predictors in the models: maximum NDVI value (indicating how much vegetation there is per pixel), and the difference between maximum and minimum NDVI value (indicating
variability in vegetation per pixel). &lt;br&gt;
To reduce colinearity among predictors and over-fitting, the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was calculated for the continuous predictors using R v2.15.0 (R Development Core Team, 2012) and used to prune predictors before use (e.g. Bombi et al.,
2012) until all remaining variables yielded VIF values below 10 (Table 1): these were then used in the Maxent modelling. &lt;br&gt;
Climate models used &lt;br&gt;
To estimate the potential impact of climate change, current distribution models were projected into the future for three time slices (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, each the median of a 30-year window). Future climate data (IPCC, 2007: downloaded from
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ccafs-climate.org/)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.ccafs-climate.org/)&lt;/a&gt; derived from four independent Global Circulation Models (GCMs) were used to obtain consensus estimations about the fate of the herpetofauna. These GCMs were the Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 (HadCM3), the
Canadian second-generation coupled global climate model (CGCM2-CCCma), the Australian model (CSIRO Mk2) and a Japanese model (NIES99), all frequently used in similar studies (e.g. AraÃºjo et al., 2006; Holt et al., 2009). Our results assume that
species try to track their suitable habitat (dependent on dispersal ability) rather than accommodate or adapt to the new conditions. &lt;br&gt;
For each GCM model and time slice, two emission scenarios (A2a and B2a) were used, the most commonly used scenarios in climate-change assessments (Hannah, 2011). They reflect two different assumptions about the levels of CO2 emissions, linked to
assumed demographic changes and socio-economic and technological developments (Marini et al., 2009). The A2a scenario assumes a lot of climate change caused by medium to high CO2 emission rates (the âbusiness as usualâ scenario), while the B2a
scenario assumes relatively little change because of mitigation measures (the âmoderateâ scenario) (Sauer et al., 2011; Taubmann et al., 2011). There are no data on how NDVI and habitat variables might change in Egypt in the future, and so we
assume they (and altitude) remain constant. Apart from the A2a scenario for 2080, nearly all the expected climatic conditions are similar to current values (see Fig. S4).&lt;br&gt;
Species distribution modelling &lt;br&gt;
We used Maxent v3.3.3k (Phillips et al., 2006 â see: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.princeton.edu/â¼schapire/maxent/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.cs.princeton.edu/â¼schapire/maxent/&lt;/a&gt;) to run the species distribution models. Maxent performs well in comparison with alternative algorithms and shows equal or higher predictive
accuracy on cross-validation (Elith et al., 2006; Hernandez et al., 2006). Crucial to our decision not to use ensemble modelling, Maxent is very robust to small numbers of training records, outperforms other algorithms when using a relatively
small number of occurrence records (Franklin, 2009), and is robust against moderate location errors (Graham et al., 2008). We used âpermutation importanceâ (see Phillips and AT&amp;amp;T Research, 2011) to detect which predictor had the greatest influence
on the model because it does not depend on the path used by the algorithm (Songer et al., 2012). &lt;br&gt;
Ten replicated runs with cross-validation and default settings (except iterations = 1000) were made for each species, by iteratively partitioning the records to use 90% for training and 10% for testing (as recommended by Phillips and AT&amp;amp;T
Research, 2011); this gives a more stable model performance (avoiding overfitting) and minimises the effects of errors and biases. The default logistic output format was chosen, i.e. related to probability of suitable conditions, ranging from 0 to
1. Logistic output has been criticized recently (e.g. Merow et al., 2013) because many users assume that it represents the probability of occurrence; to do that, however, the calculation must assume that overall prevalence is fixed at 0.5 for all
species, which may not be accurate: estimating true prevalence is very difficult (Elith et al., 2011). Both logistic and raw outputs are monotonically related and rank locations identically (Elith et al., 2011), making rank-based measures such as
AUC (for model evaluation: Elith et al., 2011) and thresholding (using values from predictions of the training presence locations, e.g. 10th-percentile threshold) identical whichever is used. We used logistic output for two main reasons: a) it
standardises the expected habitat suitability values across species, permitting the adding together of species to create the âprobability richnessâ maps; b) it allows Maxent automatically to convert the probabilities into expected presence/absence
(or, more precisely, suitable/non-suitable) habitat. For the latter we used the 10th-percentile training presence threshold (following Pearson et al., 2007). For each species (and for each of the logistic and thresholded distributions), the ten
replicate distribution maps were converted to a single consensus map, by Maxent for logistic values, and manually for thresholded values (where each pixel was a consensus presence if it had presence values in more than half of the model runs, i.e.
&amp;gt;5). &lt;br&gt;
Distributions were then projected into three future time slices (2020, 2050, and 2080), in each of four GCM models (HadCM3, CCCma, CSIRO, and NIES99) and two emission scenarios (A2a and B2a), giving a total of 24 future projections. Thresholded
future distributions involved two extreme assumptions about dispersal ability: unlimited and no dispersal. For each of the 24 projections, three consensus maps were produced; one using the probability (logistic) output, and two using the
thresholded distributions (assuming unlimited and no-dispersal). The maps were then averaged across the different GCMs; for thresholded distributions, this involved assigning a pixel as potentially suitable if it had a value of presence in more
than two GCMs. Thus there were 18 (three time slices, two scenarios, three consensus) maps per species. &lt;br&gt;
2.5. Comparisons across species &lt;br&gt;
Current and future maps of estimated species richness were calculated in two different ways: first, by simply adding together the average probability of suitable conditions for each pixel across the distribution maps of all species (this assumes
unlimited dispersal; e.g. Gilbert and Zalat, 2008); and second, by adding together the thresholded distribution maps (under unlimited- and no-dispersal assumptions; e.g. Trotta-Moreu and Lobo, 2010). Maps of future species richness were obtained
for each of the 24 future projections and then averaged across the four GCMs. Future potential changes in species richness (but not composition) were calculated by subtracting current species richness at each pixel. &lt;br&gt;
At the species level, gains and losses in future distribution were calculated using current and future consensus thresholded distributions. Then the losses across all the 24 future potential distributions across all species were added together
into a species loss map, showing which areas are expected to suffer most in losing species (for each dispersal assumption). The same was carried out for gains in suitability to produce a species gain map, showing which areas are expected to gain
species (only for the unlimited dispersal assumption). Species turnover, an index of dissimilarity between current and future species composition (Thuiller, 2004) was calculated for each future projection and dispersal assumption (following
Thuiller et al., 2005). &lt;br&gt;
In order to assess future extinction risk and to determine which species may require more protection in the future, species range changes were calculated as the percentage loss (or gain) in suitable habitats, carried out for each dispersal
assumption. Each species was classified into one of the following categories: Extinct (expected loss of the entire suitable habitat - 100%), Critically Endangered (loss &amp;gt;80%), Endangered (loss 50â80%), Vulnerable (loss 30â50%), Least Concern (loss
30%), gain 1 (gain 30%), gain 2 (gain 30â50%), gain 3 (gain 50â80%), gain 4 (gain 80â100%), and gain 5 (gain &amp;gt;100) (modified from Thuiller et al., 2005) (see Tables S2âS3). &lt;br&gt;
Area prioritization for conservation &lt;br&gt;
Several algorithms are now available to prioritize areas for conservation and conservation planning. Using the SDM predictions, Zonation v3.1 (Moilanen et al., 2012) created a nested spatial conservation prioritization network to evaluate the
effectiveness and performance of current Protected Area network in Egypt and identify new sites for conservation. Zonation prioritizes the conservation value of the landscape hierarchically based on the conservation value of sites (cells)
(Moilanen et al., 2012), by iteratively removing the least valuable cells from the edges of the landscape according to set rules. The last to be removed are the most important areas (Moilanen et al., 2012). We used two removal rules: âbasic
core-area functionâ, to identify important (or poor) locations where a single or a few species have important occurrences; and âadditive benefit functionâ, to give more weight to locations with high species richness (Moilanen et al., 2012).
Fragmentation of the chosen areas is minimized by an aggregation rule, and we chose to use âdistribution smoothingâ, for which an estimate of dispersal distance is required. The dispersal ability of almost all terrestrial reptile species is very
limited (Cadby et al., 2010; Edgar et al., 2010). To be conservative, in this study the dispersal distance of all reptiles was set to be equal to 1 km. &lt;br&gt;
Because some species are more important to conserve than others, each species was given a weight. Weights were developed from the global and national IUCN assessments, the world distribution, and distribution patterns within Egypt. Following
Gilbert and Zalat (2008) and Basuony et al. (2010), we classified Egyptian reptiles according to their world distribution and their distribution pattern within Egypt. We assessed their IUCN Red List status in Egypt according to IUCN guideline and
categories (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee, 2010), although inevitably incomplete. We gave each element a score (modified from Leach et al., 2013) to indicate relative importance, and then the sum of the scores gave the relative
conservation weight of each species (see Tables S1 and S4). We used these values to weight the Zonation prioritization process. &lt;br&gt;
For current and future climates, Zonation was run using the maps of habitat suitabilities for all species. The number of cells removed at each iteration was set to 10 (=âwarp factorâ). Zonation produces ASCII raster files with ranked pixel values
scaled to be from 0 to 1: values &amp;gt; 0.7 were considered to be of high conservation importance. These important areas were then overlaid with the current Protected Area network in Egypt to show if the network in Egypt is adequate to conserve the
species in the face of climate change, and if there are areas outside the current Protected Areas boundaries that require special protection measures. &lt;br&gt;
Model performance &amp;amp; variable importance &lt;br&gt;
In terms of mean AUC values for the 10 cross-validation runs, the performance of current-distribution models was good (see Table S1), ranging from 0.78 to 0.99 with an overall mean of 0.93 Â± 0.05. Only one species (Ptyodactylus siphonorhina) had a
mean AUC of less than 0.8, while in 36 species it was greater than 0.95. As almost all species had a mean AUC &amp;gt;0.8, all models were accepted and processed for further analyses. More widespread species tended to have lower AUC values (correlations
[n = 75] with: number of suitable pixels, rs = â0.85, p 0.005; extent of occurrence, rs = â0.77, p 0.005; number of pixels with records, rs = â0.433, p 0.005). &lt;br&gt;
Variables with highest mean permutation importance across all modelled species were altitude (highest for 34 species), Bio4 (temperature seasonality, 10 species), and Bio13 (precipitation of wettest month, 9 species). Those with the lowest mean
permutation importance, and thus not influencing the final models very much, were the difference between maximum and minimum NDVI, Bio15 (precipitation seasonality), habitat and Bio9 (mean temperature of driest quarter); the first and last of
these were never the most influential variable for any species. &lt;br&gt;
Species richness &lt;br&gt;
The patterns of current species richness (Fig 1) were similar using either logistic or thresholded distributions, both emphasizing the lower Nile Valley, the Suez Canal area, and the coasts of the Mediterranean and Suez Gulf (Fig. S2 for locations
map). The pattern is concordant with the species richness map in Baha El Din (2006), produced using records and qualitative criteria (see Fig. S5a). Under climate change, regardless of emission scenario or dispersal assumptions, several areas are
expected to have increased species richness (Fig. 2), with generally greater magnitudes under the A2a scenario, while others are expected to decline (e.g. the Suez Canal area), with greater declines under the B2a scenario by 2050 and 2080. &lt;br&gt;

(shown in Fig. 1a), and is averaged across four GCM models. Maps made (a) using Maxent logistic output; and (b) using thresholded distributions (see Methods). &lt;br&gt;
Areas with the highest expected loss of species include between greater Cairo, Ismailia and Suez, south of Suez on both sides of the Suez Gulf, and Wadi El-Natrun, much greater under the B2a scenario (Fig. 3a). If species can disperse well, then
the highest gains in species are expected to include a large proportion of the northern half of the Western Desert, again greater under the B2a scenario (Fig. 3b). In terms of percentage change of the reptile assemblage, if dispersal is unlimited
then the Western Desert is expected to undergo high turnover (Fig. S6a), but this is because there are so few species there currently. Under no dispersal, turnover is very limited (Fig. S6b), again with highest values again in the Western desert
because of the species poor assemblages there. &lt;br&gt;
Fig. 3. Expected patterns of cumulative (a) losses, and (b) gains of species as a result of climate change. The losses of each species in each pixel (under both dispersal assumptions) and gains (under unlimited dispersal only) were averaged across
GCM models, accumulated across species, and then plotted. &lt;br&gt;
Range and status changes &lt;br&gt;
With unlimited dispersal, no species is expected to become âextinctâ (100% loss of suitable habitat) under all or the average of all GCMs. There are a couple of species expected to become extinct by losing their entire area of suitable habitat in
at least one of the future projections: Tarentola mindiae and Hemidactylus robustus. Using the average gain or loss of suitable habitat across the four different GCMs, eight species are expected to be classified as Critically Endangered (loss &amp;gt;
80%), twenty as Endangered (loss 50â80%), and twenty-two as Vulnerable (loss 30â50%) in at least one mean future projection (details, see Table S2). &lt;br&gt;
When assuming no dispersal at all, none of the species are expected to lose all suitable habitats under all or the average of all GCMs, but T. mindiae and H. robustus again experience complete loss of habitat under at least one of the projections.
Using the average loss of suitable habitat across the four different GCMs, ten species are expected to be classified as Critically Endangered, twenty-seven as Endangered, and thirty-three as Vulnerable in at least one mean future projection
(details, see Table S3). &lt;br&gt;
Area prioritization for conservation &lt;br&gt;
The areas with the highest current prioritization value for conservation were similar for both cell-removal methods, mainly emphasizing the north coast, Suez Canal area, South Sinai, the Gebel Elba region, Qattara Depression, Wadi El-Natrun, and
around Cairo &amp;amp; Fayoum, with the âadditive benefitâ function putting greater emphasis on the Nile Delta and its fringing areas (Fig. 4). This overall pattern does not change much under future climate projections, though a few areas decline in
priority and much greater area of the northern Western Desert increases. These effects are more pronounced with the âcore-area functionâ used as the cell removal rule. &lt;br&gt;
Current conservation prioritizationl of areas, according to the Zonationâ¦ &lt;br&gt;
Fig. 4. Current conservation prioritizationl of areas, according to the Zonation algorithm under two cell removal rules: (a) core-area function (identifies areas where one or more species have important occurrences); and (b) additive benefit
function (which gives greater emphasis to areas with high species richness). Darker colours represent higher conservation value. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of
this article.) &lt;br&gt;
The mean prioritization value in all models was higher in Protected Areas than outside them (Fig. 5), with both slightly increasing in future projections. The difference in prioritization value between inside and outside Protected Areas declined
with time, especially by 2050 and 2080 under the B2a scenario. &lt;br&gt;

The results of this study show for first time the potential impacts of climate change on the distribution of Egyptian reptiles. Some reptiles are expected to lose much of their currently suitability areas (up to 80% in some cases), and some areas
will lose or change a large proportion of their species. Thus there will be a need for greater conservation efforts in the future. Some of these areas are already inside Protected Areas and so hypothetically they are protected, while others are
either just outside or very far from Protected Areas. Although overall Protected Areas contain better (higher priority) values compared to unprotected sites, the current Protected-Area network appears inadequate for future conservation. Our
results together with others (e.g. Leach et al., 2013) will help the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency and other decision-making parties in Egypt to direct conservation efforts and limited conservation resources in the right direction. &lt;br&gt;
Model performance &amp;amp; variable importance &lt;br&gt;
The negative correlations found between AUC and the area occupied, and with the extent of occurrence, concur with findings of many other studies (e.g. Brotons et al., 2004; Elith et al., 2006; Hernandez et al., 2006). Rare species are usually
habitat specialists, with narrow environmental tolerances, and are environmentally or geographically restricted compared to widespread species (Elith et al., 2006; Pandit et al., 2009). Widespread species are likely to be generalists occupying a
wide range of habitats and climates, making it difficult to distinguish between suitable and unsuitable habitats (Franklin et al., 2009). However, as pointed out by Elith et al. (2006), this may be an artefact, an inevitable result for species
with small relative occurrence areas, and perhaps a reason not to use AUC to compare model performances (Lobo et al., 2008). Most (about 60%) of the Egyptian herpetofauna are narrowly distributed, occupying less than 10% of Egypt&amp;rsquo;s area (Baha El
Din, 2006). There is no evidence of a strong correlation between model accuracy and the number of records used (see Elith et al., 2006; Newbold et al., 2009b), and the weak negative correlation found here is unusual since most (e.g. Stockwell and
Peterson, 2002; Hernandez et al., 2006) find that models with larger sample sizes have higher accuracy (but see de Pous et al., 2011). &lt;br&gt;
We found altitude to be the most effective predictor for many species. In contrast, the NDVI predictors were not useful, unlike in many other cases (e.g. Egbert et al., 2002; Anderson et al., 2006; Kgosiesele, 2010; Taheri, 2010), but perhaps
typical for arid environments (e.g. Soultan&amp;rsquo;s (2011) study on Egyptian antelopes) or for herpetofauna (e.g. Teodoro et al., 2013). Habitat categories likewise made only a low contribution to the reptile models. &lt;br&gt;
Species richness &lt;br&gt;
Species richness by itself is not adequate as an indicator of biotic change, since species composition can change independently. Our results suggest that in the future some areas with currently high expected species richness may lose many species,
or undergo large changes in species composition. Some of these areas are already under a certain degree of protection, but even if they can be maintained or enhanced (e.g. Siwa oasis, Gebel Elba, and the coastal areas over the Aqaba gulf: Fig.
S2), current Protected Areas are not sufficient to prevent expected loss of species. Other areas (e.g. Wadi El-Natrun, the Suez Canal area, Red Sea inland wadis, the poorly known Qattara Depression, and the areas around Gebel El-Gallala and Gebel
El-Hallal) are unprotected and measures are needed to conserve them. There are similar situations elsewhere: for example, high species loss and turnover in the reptiles of a priority conservation hotspot in Europe (the Iberian Peninsula) are
expected (de Pous, 2011), with great variation in expected patterns of loss and change with different projections and dispersal assumptions. Other studies have also concluded that large changes are likely in chelonians worldwide (Ihlow et al.,
2012), Mediterranean mammals (Maiorano et al., 2011), US trees and vertebrates (Currie, 2001) and MesoAmerican trees (Golicher et al., 2012). &lt;br&gt;
Range and status changes &lt;br&gt;
Two species are expected to lose their suitable habitats entirely in at least one future projection: 1) T. mindiae is a near-endemic species recorded just from northwest Egypt and northern Cyrenaica (eastern Libya); its distribution in Egypt is
restricted to Siwa oasis, the Qattara Depression and their periphery (Baha El Din, 2006). Future range changes suggest it will be Endangered (loss 50â80%) by 2020 and as Critically Endangered (loss &amp;gt;80%) by 2050 and 2080 (under all emission
scenarios and dispersal assumptions). 2) H. robustus is localized to the East African coast from Zanzibar to southern Egypt, Arabia, east to Pakistan; its distribution in Egypt is on the Red Sea coast from El-Quseir southwards (Baha El Din, 2006).
The A2a scenario suggests it will be Critically Endangered by 2020 and 2050, while under the B2a scenario it will be Endangered by 2020 and Critically Endangered by 2050 and 2080. More than half of its current distribution in Egypt is located
within the Wadi El-Gemal and Gebel Elba Protected Areas, so hypothetically it is protected. However, it is found mainly on buildings and hence associated with man; it may in fact be an invasive to Egypt. &lt;br&gt;
Another eight species are expected to be classified as Critically Endangered (loss &amp;gt;80%) in at least one averaged future projection (Acanthodactylus longipes, Cerastes vipera, Eryx jaculus, Eumeces schneiderii, Malpolon moilensis, Ptyodactylus
guttatus, P. siphonorhina and Trapelus mutabilis). According to the current assessment, twenty-seven species are classified as Endangered (loss 50â80%) in at least one projection (mostly by 2080 in the A2 scenario); two of these are classified,
assuming no dispersal, as Endangered in all future projections (Uromastyx aegyptia and Pristurus flavipunctatus; for details see: Tables S2âS3). &lt;br&gt;
Reptiles are also likely to gain from global warming, especially in more northern areas of the globe, if they can disperse and expand their distributions, but under perhaps the more realistic assumption of no dispersal, most species were expected
to lose habitat suitability by 2050 (AraÃºjo et al., 2006). In Egypt, areas of clear future expected gain (assuming unlimited dispersal) are the area between the Siwa oasis and Qattara Depression, northwards almost to the northern coastal strip,
and some sparse locations in central Sinai. There were greater gains under the B2a scenario, in the eastern part of the Western Desert and some patchy areas around the Nile (Fig. 3b). This pattern is similar to that reported by Araujo et al.
(2006). &lt;br&gt;
Some of the species identified here as being most at risk due to future climate change, are in fact resilient species that are ecologically very adaptable and are currently experiencing range expansion and population growth, at least in Egypt
(e.g. H. robustus). This disparity is probably because modelling is based solely on the probable impacts of climate change on the spatial distribution of suitable habitats, without taking evolution or ecological adaptability and resilience into
account. Species vary greatly in their response to ecological change, some adapting very well even to very rapid anthropogenically induced changes (e.g. invasive species), while others are much less adaptable and tend to go extinct first. &lt;br&gt;
There are no published studies that discuss the effect of climate change on Egyptian reptiles, obviating any comparisons. Information on the reptiles of the adjacent countries of Sudan and Libya are very limited, making it impossible to assess any
movements that might compensate for Egyptian losses. The patterns of expected changes in Leach et al.&amp;rsquo;s (2013) similar study on mammals and butterflies do not concur with ours. Mammal species richness was expected to decline in the Mediterranean
and Red Sea areas (by 40â60%) and increase elsewhere (by 80â100%); while for butterflies, declines are expected over almost the whole of Egypt (by 40â60%) except the south, which is expected to increase (by 40â60%). In the models of European
reptiles (de Pous, 2011), between eight (unlimited dispersal) and 21 (no dispersal) species were expected to become extinct in at least one future projection, with two more losing more than 80% of their currently suitable habitats. This is a much
more damaging scenario than the expected responses of Egyptian reptiles in our study. There are no other comparable studies from North Africa or the Middle East. &lt;br&gt;
Area prioritization for conservation &lt;br&gt;
In our study, Protected Areas (Fig. S3) were more valuable in conserving reptiles than areas outside them both currently and in the future, although the difference is expected to get smaller with time (Fig. 5). Although this is encouraging, the
Protected Area network appears inadequate to conserve Egyptian reptiles. New Protected Areas that have already been proposed would go some way towards reducing this deficiency in coverage, although others will be needed: in the middle to north
Sinai (especially around Gebel El-Hallal), the Suez Canal area, both sides of the Suez Gulf, the northern Mediterranean coast, coastal wadis of the Red Sea between Hurghada and Mersa Alam, and the Gebel El-Gallala area. More effective protection
is required in the established Protected Areas, including those in South Sinai, Gebel Elba, and Siwa oasis due to their relatively high expected future suitability loss. The Protected Areas of Siwa oasis and El-Gilf El-Kebir plus the areas of Wadi
El-Natrun, the Gebel El-Hallal area and wadis of the Red Sea are expected to have particularly high turnover in species composition (Fig. S6), and hence probably need more conservation efforts. Some comparable information is available for Egypt&amp;rsquo;s
butterflies and mammals (Gilbert and Zalat, 2008; Basuony et al., 2010; Leach et al., 2013). Egypt&amp;rsquo;s network of Protected Areas appears adequate to conserve Egyptian butterfly hotspots, except for the Mediterranean coast between Alexandria and
Sallum (Gilbert and Zalat, 2008), but inadequate to conserve important mammal areas, with new Protected Areas needed to be constructed in the lower Nile Valley, along the north coast between Alexandria and Sallum, top part of the Suez Gulf, and
perhaps the Qattara Depression (Basuony et al., 2010). Suggestions for conserving mammals are consistent to some extent with our results, which also suggest new Protected Areas along the Suez Gulf, Mediterranean coast from Mersa Matruh to Sallum,
and the Qattara Depression. Leach et al. (2013) concur with our results in suggesting priority areas along the western Mediterranean coast, around Greater Cairo, central and north Sinai, and the Red Sea coast. &lt;br&gt;
Limitations &lt;br&gt;
There are some limitations of the results shown in this study. 1) Egyptian climate data in WorldClim are interpolated from rather few non-randomly placed weather stations in Egypt and adjacent countries. Although making the climate data less
reliable than elsewhere, there are no alternative climate data available. 2) An ensemble approach (e.g. using BIOMOD; Thuiller et al., 2009) is often suggested for SDM modelling to avoid dependence on one particular algorithm. This is not possible
without a greater number of records, since other algorithms are not as flexible or robust as Maxent. Despite all the caveats with using SDMs, and criticisms of Maxent in particular (Royle et al., 2012; but see Hastie and Fithian, 2013; Elith et
al., 2006; Hernandez et al., 2006), in practice countries such as Egypt have little else to guide them in attempts at climate change adaptation. 3) There were signs of sampling bias in the available records. Although this violates the assumptions
of all SDMs, it is a problem common to nearly all datasets worldwide. New techniques may allow for the correction of sampling bias; e.g. using target-group approach (Phillips et al., 2009), although the data requirements are currently impossible
for Egypt and most other developing countries), 4) Using Maxent&amp;rsquo;s default settings is criticized by some authors: they need to be modified dependent on the data (Warren and Seifert, 2011; Radosavljevic and Anderson, 2014; Merow et al., 2013); but
we think using the default settings is enough in this study. &lt;br&gt;
Conclusion &lt;br&gt;
Although Egyptian datasets exist, knowledge of Egyptian species and conservation priorities are limited (with consequences explored in Leach et al., 2013); nevertheless our results and those of Leach et al. (2013) encourage us to believe that
useful insights can be gained for conservation priorities by using the combination of species distribution modelling plus spatial conservation prioritization techniques (Hannah, 2010; Klorvuttimontara et al., 2011). It is crucial for the Egyptian
Environmental Affairs Agency to establish an accurate and reliable database of records, assessed by experts, to help improve the basic information for future conservation assessments and analyses. &lt;br&gt;
Although many SDM studies have been done on a variety of organisms in recent decades aiming to solve conservation problems, evidence of their practical utility in real-world conservation is sparse, with very few studies clearly targeting
conservation decisions (Guisan et al., 2013). If implemented correctly, SDMs can play a critical role in supporting spatial conservation decision-making (Addison et al., 2013). For reptiles, there is a shortage of studies estimating their response
to expected climate changes (AraÃºjo et al., 2006). Although some suggest that reptiles (and to a greater extent, amphibians) will be strongly affected by climate change (e.g. Gibbons et al., 2000; AraÃºjo et al., 2006; Carvalho et al., 2010), very
few of them were concerned with arid environments or the Middle East. We hope that this and other similar studies that estimate the fate of reptiles under climate change help decision-making authorities to take the measures necessary to conserve
them.&lt;br&gt;

Hemidactylus flaviviridis: a very densely populated species and likely to be associated with man. &lt;br&gt;
Pristurus flavipunctatus: based on its narrow habitat, strict containment in natural habitats, low densities, and high vulnerability of habitat, it does fit the VU category. &lt;br&gt;
Tarentola mindiae: based on its current distribution, it has quite a large range but a rather narrow habitat. It may be reasonable to be classified at higher threat level (possibly Near Threatened âNTâ). &lt;br&gt;
Trapelus savignii: expected to have higher threat level. &lt;br&gt;
Uromastyx ornata: suggested to have a lower threat level even though its range in Egypt is very small and its population size is smaller as well. &lt;br&gt;
Chamaeleo africanus: Could be of lower threat category due to its large range in Egypt (essentially the whole Nile Valley) and quite dense populations which are expanding rapidly. It also has a very large African range; even invaded parts of
Greece. &lt;br&gt;
Acanthodactylus pardalis: should have a greater threat level. It is practically extinct! &lt;br&gt;
Chalcides cf. humilis: more recent data indicate its very widespread distribution in Egypt, it occupies a range equal or greater than that of C. ocellatus. &lt;br&gt;
Eryx jaculus: should be classified at a higher threat status than E.colubrinus or at least equal to it. It is almost extinct from Egypt. &lt;br&gt;
Testudo kleinmanni: in reality it may be extinct. &lt;br&gt;

The Desert Beauty Calopieris eulimene: a butterfly new to Egypt (Insecta: Lepidoptera)&lt;br&gt;
Zoology in the Middle East 62:3(279-281)&lt;br&gt;

The butterfly genus Calopieris Aurivillius, 1898 has only one species: the Desert Beauty Calopieris eulimene (Klug, 1829) (Ackery, Smith, &amp;amp; Vane-Wright, 1985), which is a rare Afrotropical species considered to be one of the most xerophilic butterflies in Africa (T. Larsen, pers. comm.; Williams, 2015). It is endemic to the Somali sub-region (Nazari et al., 2011), having been recorded only from Sudan, Yemen, western Saudi Arabia (20 km south of Mecca), Chad, Eritrea, and Ethiopia (T. Larsen, pers. comm.; Ackery et al., 1985; Gabriel, 1949; Larsen, 1982; Williams, 2015). The type specimens come from Ambukol, Dongola district, Sudan (Longstaff, 1913). The distribution is shown in Figure 1. Most of the available records are from between 1828 and 1980, with only one relatively recent record in 2007 from South of Jebel Aulla, Sudan (Williams, 2015). It is a poorly known butterfly with relatively few records and hardly any information on its biology and ecology (T. Larsen,
pers. comm.; but see Waterfield, 1925). &lt;br&gt;
The larvae turn up on the leafless bushes of the Desert Caper Capparis decidua (Capparaceae), and adults are mostly associated with it (Ackery, Smith, &amp;amp; Vane-Wright, 1985; Longstaff, 1913): it does not seem to visit the flowers of other plants
(Waterfield, 1925). &lt;br&gt;
Many (20-30) individuals of C. eulimene were recorded on 29 May 2011 and 29 November 2012 in a small wadi named âSrob Kwanâ in the Meisah area of the Gebel Elba Protected Area (22.31Â°N, 35.60Â°E; 451 m a.s.l.) in southern Egypt. The adults were
found hovering over the Desert Caper (Capparis decidua; local name: Tundob; Figure 2), confirming previous observations (e.g. Ackery et al., 1985). The surrounding wadis were roughly surveyed on the same days, but no other populations of C.
eulimene were observed. Other recorded butterfly species included Danaus chrysippus, Pontia glauconome, Colotis danae, C.chrysonome, and C.liagore. &lt;br&gt;
Based on the two most recent comprehensive studies on the Egyptian butterflies, there are 61 butterfly species recorded from Egypt (Gilbert &amp;amp; Zalat, 2007; Larsen, 1990). C.eulimene has not been reported from Egypt before, although Larsen (1990)
expected its distribution to extend to the extreme south of Egypt. &lt;br&gt;
The Desert Caper is widespread in Egypt, inhabiting desert wadis and sandy alluvial plains. It is found in various phytogeographical regions in Egypt, including the Nile region, oases, desert areas, the Red Sea coastal strip, Sinai, and Gebel Elba
(Boulos, 1999). In Gebel Elba Protected Area, it has been recorded from many locations (for details: Al-Gohary, 2009). It has also been recorded from other locations in southern Egypt, including Wadi El Gemal and Wadi El Allaqi Protected Areas
(Mahmoud &amp;amp; Gairola, 2013; Springuel, Sheded, &amp;amp; Murphy, 1997). The presence of the Desert Caper at different locations in southern Egypt may support the existence of C. eulimene populations at other places in southern Egypt, especially since such
places are often remote areas that receive very low sampling effort: sampling is commonly biased towards areas close to main cities or roads. Given that C. eulimene has been recorded so far only from a very small region in Egypt, it gives the
Gebel Elba Protected Area high responsibility to conserve this species and its habitat, and other nearby Protected Areas (Wadi El Allaqi, Wadi El Gemal) should be thoroughly explored to show more accurately its distribution within Egypt. &lt;br&gt;

Abstract 
 
Climate change  has  caused range shifts  and  extinctions  of  many  species  in 
the past. In this study, the effects of climate change on Egyptian reptiles, as a 
representative of the Egyptian fauna, was investigated for the first time using 
species distribution models, relatively new tools now used in a variety of fields 
from  conservation  planning  to  the  assessment  of  speciesâ  responses  to 
climate  change.  In  this  study,  the  Maxent  algorithm  was  used  to  model  the 
current and future distributions of 75 terrestrial reptile species from Egypt. The 
modelled distribution for current conditions for each species was projected into 
the  future  for  three  time  slices  (2020,  2050  and  2080)  using  two  emission 
scenarios (A2a and B2a) from four global circulation models (CCCma, CSIRO, 
HadCM3  and  NIES99)  and  under  two  assumptions  of  dispersal  ability 
(unlimited dispersal and no dispersal). This produced a total of 48 projections 
for  each  species.  Current  and  future  species  richness  patterns  were 
determined from  the results using the average response  across the different 
global  circulation  models  to  represent  a  consensus  view.  For  each  species, 
possible  changes  in  range  were  calculated  and used  to  assess  future  threat 
status. A national Red Data listing for the Egyptian reptiles was determined to 
show  which species require  more conservation  measures. Zonation software 
was  used  for  conservation  prioritization  to  show  which  areas  require  more 
protection under current  and future climates,  and to  assess the  effectiveness 
of Egyptâs Protected Areas network to conserve reptiles. 
Climate change  is  predicted  to  vary  in  its  effects  spatially,  with  some 
areas  characterized  by  increased  species  richness  while  others  show 
declines.  Future  range  changes  are  predicted  to  vary  among  species  and 
among different future projections, from the loss of the entire range (Tarentola 
mindiae  and  Hemidactylus  robustus)  to  large  gains  in  range  (Hemidactylus 
flaviviridis). No species was predicted to lose its entire currently suitable range 
under  all  scenarios.  Tarentola  mindiae  and  Hemidactylus  robustus  were 
predicted  to  become  extinct  from  Egypt  in  the  future  in  at  least  one  future 
projection.  Another  eight  species  were  predicted  to  lose  more  than  80%  of 
their  current  distribution  in  the  future.  According  to  IUCN  guidelines  and 
III 
 
criteria,  under  current  conditions,  three  species  were  classified  as  nationally 
Endangered and 24 species as Vulnerable.  
Although Protected Areas have greater conservation value compared to 
unprotected areas, Egyptâs Protected-Areas network seems to be inadequate 
to conserve Egyptian reptiles.  My results suggest the need  to construct  new 
Protected  Areas  in  a  variety  of  places  across  northern  Egypt  from  between 
Mersa Matruh and Sallum to the Gebel El-Hallal area in northern Sinai. Some  
Protected Areas require stricter protection in the future to counter the threats 
derived from climate change.

am particularly  grateful  to him  and Prof. Samy Zalat (Suez Canal  University, 
Egypt)  for  their  enthusiasm,  encouragement  and  guidance  through  the  past 
several  years  since  working  under  their  supervision  at  the  BioMAP  project. 
This thesis would not have been completed without their support. 
Many  thanks  are  given  for:  Dr.  Tim  Newbold  (UNEP-WCMC  and 
Microsoft  Research  Fellow)  for  introducing  GIS  and  Species  Distribution 
Modelling for me, giving me a chance to join his PhD fieldwork in Egypt and for 
sharing  his  field  records;  Dr.  Sherif  Baha  El  Din  for  providing  his  valuable 
database  records  of the Egyptian herpetofauna; Dr. Moustafa Fouda (former 
director  of  the  Nature  Conservation  Sector,  Egyptian  Environmental  Affairs 
Agency) for his support throughout my work with BioMAP project and Nature 
Conservation Sector; Mindy Baha El Din for providing valuable information on 
the current status  of the Egyptian tortoise; Abdelwahab Afefe  and  Mahmoud 
Boghdady (Nature Conservation Sector) for providing me of the coordinates of 
the  latest  declared  Protected  Areas  (Mount  Kamel  Meteor  and  El-Wahat  El-
Bahreya); BioMAP former staff and Nature Conservation Sector team; and all 
the scientists and volunteers who contributed data to the databases used. 
This  research  study  is  sponsored  by  Chevening  Scholarships.  I  am 
indebted to British Council  in Egypt  and the UK  Foreign and Commonwealth 
Office for their generous support throughout my stay in Britain.

Introduction 
 
Detailed  information  on  the  ecological  and  geographical  distributions  of 
species  is  essential  for  conservation  planning  and  forecasting  (Elith  et  al. 
2006)  especially  for  species  facing  conservation  problems  (Pineda  &amp;  Lobo 
2009). Species distribution modelling is one of many methods used to quantify 
patterns of species distributions and to extrapolate distributions across space 
and time (Elith &amp; Leathwick 2007; Franklin 2009), usually based on a statistical 
model (Franklin 2009). This is done, basically, through a class of methods that 
combine  known  species  observations  (occurrence  or  abundance  at  known 
locations) with layers of environmental variables (and/or spatial characteristics 
of those locations) that are thought to have an influence on habitat suitability 
(and so species distribution) to make a model of the environmental conditions 
that  meet  the  ecological  requirements  of  a  species,  thus  identifying  where 
these suitable conditions are distributed in space (Phillips et al. 2006; Pearson 
2007;  Elith  &amp;  Leathwick  2009;  Franklin  2009;  Warren  &amp;  Seifert  2011).  The 
output  of  most  models  aims  to  provide  detailed  predicted  distribution  maps 
(Elith et al. 2006). 
  The  earliest  attempts  at  modelling  species  distributions  using 
correlations between the  observed distribution  and climate  were  by Johnston 
(1924), who predicted the invasive spread of cactus in Australia, and Hintikka 
(1963),  who  assessed  the  climatic  determinants  of  the  distribution  of  some 
European  species  based  on  the  minimum  and  maximum  temperatures 
(Pearson &amp; Dawson 2003; Guisan &amp; Thuiller 2005). Recent years have seen 
an explosion of interest in species distribution modelling, with the publishing of 
hundreds of studies and governmental and non-governmental reports that use 
them  (Franklin  2009).  Species  distribution  models  have  been  used  in  the 
literature  under  many  different  names  including  bioclimatic  models,  climate 
envelopes,  species  niche  models,  ecological  niche  models,  niche-theory 
models, habitat models, resource selection functions, range maps and spatial 
models (Elith &amp; Leathwick 2009; Franklin 2009). They can also be referred to 
as  habitat suitability models, since  they are said to describe the suitability of 
the habitat for a particular species (Hirzel &amp; Le Lay 2008; Franklin 2009). 
- 2 - 
  They represent an approximation of the ecological niche by estimating 
the  fundamental  (physiological  or  potential)  niche,  realized  (ecological  or 
actual)  niche  or,  when  based  only  on  climate  variables,  the  &#34;climatic  niche&#34; 
(Phillips  et  al.  2006;  Franklin  2009).  According  to  Hutchinson  (1957),  the 
fundamental niche of a species is the set of all conditions that allow long-term 
survival  and  reproduction,  also  called  an  &#34;n-dimensional  hypervolume&#34; 
because of the multiple axes of the defining conditions. The realized niche, on 
the other hand, is the portion of the fundamental niche that a species actually 
occupies and from which the species is not excluded due to biotic interactions 
(Pulliam  2000;  Phillips  et  al.  2006;  Pearson  2007).  The  realized  niche  of  a 
species  is  a  subset  of  the  fundamental  niche,  usually  but  not  always  due  to 
human  disturbance,  biotic  interactions  (competition  and  predation),  or  the 
existence  of  geographical  barriers  that  have  prevented  the  dispersal  and 
colonization  of  the species (Phillips  et  al. 2006;  Franklin 2009). According to 
Hutchinsonâs definition of the realized niche, and assuming that the records do 
not come from a sink habitat (where populations cannot be maintained without 
immigrants from  elsewhere (Franklin 2009)), the  occurrence records where  a 
species  has  been  recorded  (and  subsequently  the  environmental 
characteristics  of  these  locations)  represent  a  sample  of  the  realized  niche 
(Phillips  et  al.  2006).  Using  that  sample  together  with  one  of  the  various 
possible  algorithms,  we  can  estimate  the  realized  niche  and  the  empirical 
correlation  between  distribution  and  environmental  variables  (Phillips  et  al. 
2006; Franklin 2009). In reality, the predicted distribution does not fully reflect 
the requirements and realized niche of the species because of various factors 
not  incorporated  into  the  model  (such  as  biotic  interactions,  geographic 
barriers  and species  history).  Because  of  this,  distribution  models  should  be 
interpreted with caution (Pearson &amp; Dawson 2003; Pearson et al. 2007) . 
  Recently,  species  distribution  models  have  developed  into  innovative 
and  valuable  techniques  used  to  generate  biogeographical  information 
applicable  to  various  fields  including  conservation  biology,  ecological 
restoration,  biodiversity  assessment,  reserve planning  and  design,  evolution, 
resource management and habitat management and restoration (Phillips et al. 
2006;  Pearson  2007;  Franklin  2009).  In  poorly  surveyed  areas,  they  can  be 
used  to  direct  additional  surveys  or  discover  new  species  (Raxworthy  et  al. 
- 3 - 
2003).  They  have  proven  themselves  to  be  an  important  component  in 
predicting  the  potential  anthropogenic  effects  on  biodiversity  (Guisan  &amp; 
Thuiller 2005) and assessing the invasive potential of non-native species (Elith 
et  al.  2006).  Another  growing  application  is  to  predict  the  distributions  of 
harmful pests  and disease hosts and  vectors that  affect humans, plants,  and 
animals,  providing  information  on  the  potential  distribution  or  outbreaks  of 
these pathogens and thus supporting public health and epidemiology (Franklin 
2009)  (examples  include:  Kelly  &amp;  Meentemeyer  2002;  Levine  et  al.  2004; 
Saathoff et al. 2005; Peterson 2006; Zeilhofer et al. 2007; Meentemeyer et al. 
2011). 
  Here I first review the way in which species distribution models use data 
and the choice of algorithm, and then look at ways of validating such models. I 
then consider in more detail the algorithm that I chose to use, called MaxEnt, 
before  reviewing  the  ways  in  which  distribution  models  have  been  used  to 
predict  future  changes  in  biodiversity  under  the  assumptions  of  models  of 
climate  change.  I  end  with  a  section  about  the  relevance  of  this  work  to  the 
Egyptian fauna  together  with the  very few previous studies  of the impacts  of 
climate change on Egyptâs biodiversity. 
 
Issues about the data required for distribution models 
Species  distribution  models  require  two  sorts  of  data  input:  biological  data 
describing  the  current  known  species  distribution  and  predictor  variables 
describing the  environmental  conditions  thought  to  affect  species  distribution 
(Pearson 2007; Phillips &amp; Dudik 2008). These two data input components are 
usually  in  the  format  suitable  for  visualizing  on  a  Geographic  Information 
System (GIS). The biological data usually come in the form of geo-databases 
containing the georeferenced records of the occurrences of species, while the 
predictor  variables  usually  come  in  the  form  of  GIS  raster  grids.  The  most 
common  predictor  variables  are  those  related  to  climate  (e.g.  temperature, 
precipitation),  topography  (e.g.  elevation,  aspect,  slope),  soil  type  and  land 
cover type (Phillips  et  al.  2006).  Some  studies  also  use  variables  describing 
the  distribution  of  interacting  species  to  improve  model  accuracy  (Newbold 
2010). Predictor variables come into two formats: continuous (any value within 
- 4 - 
a certain range; e.g. altitude, temperature or precipitation) or categorical (only 
a limited number  of  discrete  values;  e.g. habitat,  vegetation type,  land cover 
and soil) (Phillips et al. 2006; Phillips &amp; Dudik 2008). 
  In  the  context  of  species  distribution  models,  there  are  two  types  of 
biological data, either presence-only or presence/absence data. Presence-only 
data  represent  only  where  the  species  has  actually  been  collected  or 
recorded:  they  do  not  provide  information  on  where  it  was  not  recorded.  In 
contrast,  presence-absence  data,  in  addition  to  presence  records,  indicate 
areas where the species was not recorded during surveys. Presence-only data 
constitute  the  majority  of  existing  records  (Phillips  et  al.  2006;  Elith  &amp; 
Leathwick  2007),  and  are  somewhat  easier  to  collect.  The  main  sources  of 
presence-only  data  are  those  extracted  from  museum  collections,  herbaria, 
personal collections, planned surveys, casual observations, published articles 
and  reports,  and  online  databases  (e.g.  the  Global  Biodiversity  Information 
Facility,  see:  http://www.gbif.org/).  In recent  years,  data  from  many  museum 
and  herbaria  collections  have  become  available  online  over  the  internet 
(Graham et al. 2004; Newbold 2010). Most of these occurrence records were 
recorded  without  systematic  planning,  and  collection  methods  are  rarely 
known  (Elith  et  al.  2006).  Most  museum  databases,  for  example,  give 
information  on  where  the  specimens  were  collected,  but  usually  not  on  the 
location  of  surveys  that  failed  to  record  a  particular  species  (Stockwell  &amp; 
Peters  1999).  These  data,  when  used  with  caution,  can  give  invaluable 
information  on  patterns  of  distribution  (Newbold  2010)  and  be  effective  in 
calibrating distribution models for many species and regions (Elith et al. 2006). 
  Presence-absence records, on the other hand, are rarely available and 
are  often  difficult  to  obtain  accurately,  especially  in  poorly  surveyed  areas 
where modelling may hold greatest  value (Hirzel et al. 2002; Anderson et  al. 
2003; Phillips et al. 2006; Pearson 2007). Absence records may be unreliable 
or  of  questionable  value  in  many  situations  (Phillips  et  al.  2006;  Pearson 
2007): failure to detect a particular species may simply be due to inadequate 
collecting  effort  (Anderson  2003;  Graham  et  al.  2004),  or  when  the  target 
species  can  be  easily  missed  during  the  surveys  (rare  and  highly  mobile 
species)  (Pearson  et  al.  2007;  RÃ¶dder  et  al.  2011).  These  cases  are  often 
called  âfalse  absencesâ,  and  if  used  as  input,  the  distribution  model  will 
- 5 - 
interpret  the  predictor  values  of  these  locations  as  unsuitable  environmental 
conditions,  even  though  this  is  not  true  (Pearson  2007).  This  can  cause 
serious bias in the model analyses, so absence records should be used with 
caution (Hirzel et al. 2002; Pearson 2007). 
  There  are  some  other  potential  sources  of  bias  and  error  associated 
with biological data that should be carefully considered when collating records 
(Pearson  2007).  For  example,  there  can  be  error  through  incorrect 
identification  of species (Graham et al. 2004; Pearson 2007; Newbold  2010). 
Incorrect  identification  of  specimens  from  museums  and  collections  can  be 
detected  by  re-examining  the  original  specimens  (Newbold  2010).  There  is 
also  a  certain  degree  of  uncertainty  and  error  with  spatial  referencing  of 
samples.  Historic  data,  for  example,  often  have  location  descriptions  that 
represent  only  a  coarse  estimate  of  the  true  location,  in  contrast  to  more 
recent records from the last 20 years many of which have been georeferenced 
with GPS technology with location precision down to 1 m (Reside et al. 2011). 
Other  errors  include  transcribing  mistakes  while  transferring  data  from  field 
sheets  to  electronic  databases  (some  of  which  are  correctable  by  data 
cleaning)  and  transliterating  site  names  from  local  language  into  Latin script 
(especially  from  particular  languages  such  as  Arabic,  which  has  no  official 
method  of  transliteration  into  English:  every  writer  performs  a  new 
transliteration  as  if  from  scratch  (Gilbert  &amp;  Zalat  2008)).  Georeferencing  the 
records can introduce further errors; the textual description of the location may 
be very far from precise, describing a very broad or vague area (e.g. Egypt or 
Western desert) or include an ill-defined offset (e.g. 15 km NE of Wadi Feiran). 
In  such  cases  there  are  additional  sources  of  uncertainty:  errors  with 
measuring  the  extent  of  the  area  name,  the  direction  and  the  measure  of 
distance  (Wieczorek  et  al.  2004;  Graham  et  al.  2008;  Newbold  2010).  In 
certain situations,  the  collector  may  not  have  provided  enough  details  of  the 
recording  sites,  and  often  there  can  be  several  sites  with  the  same  name  in 
the  study  area.  For  example,  there  are  two  widely  separated  areas  in  Egypt 
named  Gebel  El-Ahmar  (in  South  Sinai  and  Giza  governorate):  mistakenly 
locating a record in the wrong location has the potential to cause great error in 
the model, especially if dealing with endemic species or species with restricted 
- 6 - 
ranges.  In  such  cases,  the  safest  way  is  to  ignore  the  record,  unless  more 
details can be found that establish which site is correct. 
  Presence-only  records  are  usually  highly  non-random  in  space  and 
time,  especially  those  derived  from  casual  observations  or  Natural  History 
museums and herbaria (Franklin 2009). This introduces another source of bias 
to  the  model,  of  which there  are four  types:  spatial,  environmental,  temporal 
and  taxonomic  (SoberÃ³n  et  al.  2000;  Newbold  2010).  Records  are  often 
collected closer to cities, roads, rivers, and coasts (SoberÃ³n et al. 2000; Reddy 
&amp;  DÃ¡valos  2003;  Kadmon  et  al.  2004;  Newbold  2010)  than  a  truly  random 
sample.  They  tend  also  to  be  close  to  the  homes  of  the  active  recorders 
(Dennis &amp; Thomas 2000; Newbold 2010) or in areas that are of high interest, 
such as Protected Areas or biodiversity hotspots (Newbold 2010). The records 
may also show spatial correlation (if collected from several nearby localities in 
a restricted area) (Phillips et al. 2006). Collectors also are more likely to focus 
on  larger,  easy-to-identify  or charismatic  organisms, causing substantial  bias 
in sampling towards flowering plants and vertebrates (Newbold 2010).  
 
The choice of model algorithms 
A  wide  variety  of  modelling  algorithms  has  been  used  recently  (Guisan  &amp; 
Thuiller  2005;  Pearson  2007).  Some  methods  are  based  on  statistical 
regression  methods  (e.g.  generalized  linear  models,  generalized  additive 
models,  multivariate  adaptive  regression  splines),  whilst  others  depend  on 
machine-learning  methods  (decision  trees,  artificial  neural  networks,  genetic 
algorithms,  maximum  entropy  and  support  vector  machines)  (Pearson  2007; 
Franklin  2009).  Some  of  these  algorithms  have  been  developed  in  user-
friendly  free  software  (Pearson  2007)  (e.g.  Maxent).  Algorithms  that  include 
the possibility of interactions between predictors are considered more suitable 
(Elith  et  al.  2006;  Pearson  2007).  Some  studies  have  founded  that  different 
modelling  algorithms  can  potentially  produce  different  predictions  (Pearson 
2007;  Pearson  et  al.  2007;  Wisz  et  al.  2008),  and  that  the  best  performing 
model is not always the same for all species (Luoto et al. 2005; Grenouillet et 
al.  2011),  so  it  is  important  to  select  the  most  appropriate  method  for  the 
species being studied (Pearson et al. 2007).

  Distribution-model  algorithms  vary  in  their  data  requirements.  Many 
require both presence  and  absence records (e.g. GLM),  while  others can be 
carried  out  without  absence  records  (e.g.  BIOCLIM,  DOMAIN,  Maxent) 
(Pearson  2007).  For  presence-only  models,  instead  of  using  real  absence 
records (especially in poorly surveyed areas where absent records are usually 
not  available),  the  model  is  applied  by  sampling  pseudo-absences  from  the 
background study area (Pearson 2007; Pearson et al. 2007). Model algorithms 
also vary in their output formats; some are continuous (yielding a probability of 
occurrence between 0 and 1), while others give a binary prediction (suitable / 
unsuitable or presence / absence) (Pearson 2007). 
  In general, predictions calibrated with fewer records  are unlikely  to be 
as  good  as those  based  on  large numbers (Wisz et al.  2008;  Franklin 2009) 
because  when  the  sample  size  is  small,  outliers  give  more  weight  to  the 
analysis  than  if  a  greater  number  of  records  compensates  for  their  effect. 
Larger  numbers  of  records  can  describe  complex  relationships  and 
requirements (Wisz et al. 2008). There is no minimum fixed number of records 
required to run an acceptable model (Franklin 2009); some studies have found 
that 50-100 records are enough to produce an acceptable model, while some 
methods, (e.g. Maxent) seem to give reasonable prediction performance when 
calibrated  with  many  fewer  records  (Wisz  et  al.  2008;  Franklin  2009)  (see 
below). 
 
Assessing model performance 
Assessing model performance is a vital step in model development (Pearson 
2007).  It  helps  to  determine  the  suitability  of  the  model  for  particular 
applications,  and to compare  different models (Pearson 2007). Nevertheless, 
model performance is just  one  aspect  of  model evaluation,  and other criteria 
should be considered, such as ecological realism, spatial pattern of error, and 
model credibility (acceptability to the user community) (Franklin 2009). 
  It  is  preferable  to  use  new  independent  data  in  model  validation 
(Pearson  2007; Pearson et  al. 2007; Franklin  2009). Sometimes  this is done 
by collecting  new independent data from different  areas (e.g. Newbold  et al. 
2010), spatial resolution,  or time period,  or  by using  data from  other surveys 
- 8 - 
(Pearson  2007).  Using  the  same  data for  running  and  evaluating  the model 
results in overestimating the predictive performance (Franklin 2009). However, 
it  is  often  not  feasible  or  cost-effective  to  collect  new  independent  data  for 
validation (Franklin 2009). In this situation it is very common to divide the data 
into  two sets prior to the running the  model,  a training (calibration)  set  and  a 
testing  (evaluation)  set.  The  partitions  can  be  either  at  random  or  spatially 
(Pearson  2007;  Franklin  2009).  The  training  set  is  used  to  build  the  model, 
while the testing set is used for model validation (Franklin 2009). The relative 
sizes  of  the  two  sets  is  somewhat  arbitrary  and  depend  on  the  number  of 
record  locations,  although  using  75%  for  training  and  25%  for  testing  has 
become common (Pearson 2007). 
  An alternative to a one-time split is to split the data into partitions many 
times;  this  is  included  in  cross-validation,  subsampling,  and  bootstrapping 
methods. In cross-validation, the occurrence records are randomly split into a 
number  of  equal-sized  sets  (&gt;2)  and  the  model  is  calibrated  by  leaving  out 
each set in turn,  which is then used for  evaluation (Pearson  2007;  Phillips &amp; 
AT&amp;T Research 2011).  The validation statistic can be calculated as the mean 
of  the  replicated  models.  A  big  advantage  of  cross-validation  over  one-time 
splitting of the data is that it uses all of the data for validation (Phillips &amp; AT&amp;T 
Research  2011).  For  rare  species  where  the  species  has  just  a  few 
occurrence  records  (&lt;20),  an  extreme  form  of  cross-validation  is 
recommended,  using  &#39;jackknifing&#39;  (Pearson  2007),  where  the  model  is 
repeatedly run  omitting  each record in turn,  with the  omitted record used for 
testing (Baldwin 2009). Jackknifing can be used with larger sample sizes, but 
creates  an  over-optimistic  estimate  of  predictive  power  (Baldwin  2009). 
Another  alternative  is  to  use  repeated  subsamples,  in  which  the  data  are 
repeatedly split randomly into training and testing subsets without replacement 
(Phillips  &amp;  AT&amp;T  Research  2011).  In  bootstrapping,  the  training  data  are 
randomly selected by sampling with replacement for multiple times (the same 
record  is  used  in  testing  more  than  once)  (Pearson  2007;  Phillips  &amp;  AT&amp;T 
Research 2011).  
  Several test statistics have been used to measure model performance, 
often derived from the presence/absence confusion matrix (Table 1) (Pearson 
et  al.  2007).  The  confusion  matrix  requires  binary  model  predictions  (i.e. 
- 9 - 
presence/absence), not continuous prediction (Pearson 2007; Franklin 2009). 
The confusion matrix uses the frequencies of each of the four possibilities: true 
positive, where the model predicts a species as present and the data confirms 
it; false positive, where the model predicts a species as present and the data 
shows absence; false negative, where the model predicts a species as absent 
and  the  data shows  present;  and  true  negative,  where the  model  predicts  a 
species as absent and the data also show absence (Pearson 2007).

It is common in distribution modelling to convert from continuous output 
(probability  of  occurrence)  to  categorical  (presence/absence  or  suitable/non-
suitable),  conventionally  done  by  using  a  threshold  value  (Franklin  2009). 
Subsequently,  so-called  &#39;threshold-dependent&#39;  measures  can  be  used  to 
evaluate models, or alternatively continuous probabilistic predictions can also 
be evaluated, so-called &#39;threshold-independent&#39; measures (Franklin 2009). 
The  confusion  matrix,  and  statistics  used  to  test  model  performance 
derived from it, requires binary predictions (presence/absence). Thus it is often 
necessary  to  convert  the  probabilities  obtained  from  continuous  models  to 
binary predictions by using this threshold (Pearson 2007). Various alternative 
methods have  been employed  to select the  best  value for the threshold (see 
Table  2  for  some  examples).  The  simplest  is  to  use  a  fixed  arbitrary  value, 
above  which  the  species  is  deemed  present;  by convention  this  threshold is 
set to  0.5 (Pearson  2007; Franklin  2009). However, this  method  is the  worst 
and  lacks  any  ecological  justification  or  reasoning  (Liu  et  al.  2005;  Pearson 
2007).  Liu  et  al.  (2005)  evaluated  the  use  of  different  threshold  criteria, 
reporting that five threshold criteria performed equally well and better than the 
others:  observed  prevalence,  average  predicted  probability,  the  sum  of 
sensitivity and specificity, sensitivity specificity quality approach, and the point 
on the ROC plot nearest the upper left corner. 
- 10 - 
For  presence-only  models,  some  studies  favored  using  &#34;lowest 
predicted  threshold&#34;,  which  equals  the  lowest  predicted  value  of  any  of  the 
presence records used to run the model (Pearson et al. 2007); this sometimes 
called  minimum training  presence.  It  is  a  conservative  threshold  that  can  be 
interpreted ecologically (Pearson et  al. 2007),  but  because  it predicts that  all 
training  records  are  correctly  predicted,  this  may  yield  over-prediction 
(Jarnevich  &amp;  Reynolds  2011).  A  more  conservative  threshold  can  be  used, 
such  as  the  value  above  which  90%  of  the  training  records  are  correctly 
classified (10 percentile training presence value) (Jarnevich &amp; Reynolds 2011); 
this  rejects  10%  of  the  training  records  with  lowest  predicted  probability  as 
unsuitable, considered appropriate since they may represent recording errors, 
migrants or ephemeral populations (Morueta-Holme et al. 2010).

distributions to binary forms (thresholded).

  Of the various ways of measuring model accuracy (Table 3), one simple 
and easy way is to calculate the percent correct classification, by dividing the 
sum  of  the  diagonals  of  the  confusion  matrix  (true  positives  and  true 
negatives) by the number of the observations (Pearson 2007; Franklin 2009). 
Although its concept is easy and logic, there are two problems with it: first, it 
does not distinguish between false negatives and false positives; second, it is 
possible to get high accuracy using a poor model when a speciesâ prevalence 
(proportion  or  frequency)  is  relatively  high  or  low  (Pearson  2007;  Franklin 
2009).  To  overcome  this  problem,  a  similar  measure  of  accuracy  has  been 
used,  called  Kappa,  which  is  considered  as  a  measure  of  categorical 
agreement that describes the difference between the observed agreement and 
chance  agreement  with  the  proportion  of  correct  predictions  expected  by 
- 11 - 
chance taken into account (Pearson 2007; Franklin 2009). Kappa, along with 
AUC  (see  below),  is  more  suitable  to  evaluate  models  in  poorly  surveyed 
regions, where absence data are not available (Pearson et al. 2007). The âtrue 
skill statisticâ is  another  method  of  measuring  model accuracy, suggested  as 
an alternative to kappa if a threshold-dependent measure is needed (Franklin 
2009):  it  is  reported  to  be  independent  of  the  species  prevalence  and  so 
considered more appropriate than kappa (Baldwin 2009).

When model output is continuous and a particular threshold measure is 
used to convert it to categorical (binary) output, the statistics derived from the 
confusion  matrix  will  be  sensitive  to  the  threshold  method  used  (Pearson 
2007). It would be useful to have a single measure of model performance that 
is  independent  of  the  threshold  choice  (Phillips  et  al.  2006);  such  measures 
could  then  be  used  to  compare  modelling  methods,  species,  candidate 
predictors,  etc.  (Franklin  2009).  One  of  the  most  frequently  used  such 
statistics  in  species  distribution  modelling  is  the  AUC  -  the  Area  Under  the 
ROC  (receiver  operating  characteristic)  Curve  (Elith  et  al.  2006;  Elith  &amp; 
Leathwick 2007). 
  The  AUC  is  derived  from  the  receiver  operating  characteristic  (ROC) 
curve (Baldwin 2009). The ROC curve is defined by plotting the false-positive 
error rate (1 - specificity) on the x-axis versus the true positive rate (sensitivity) 
- 12 - 
on  the  y-axis  across  a range  of  possible  threshold  values  (Fig.  1)  (Pearson 
2007; Franklin 2009). 
The  AUC  value  can  be  interpreted  as  the  probability  that  when  a 
presence site  and  absence site are randomly chosen, the former will have  a 
higher  predicted  value  (Elith  et  al.  2006;  Elith  &amp;  Leathwick  2007;  Franklin 
2009).  An AUC  value  of  0.8  means  that  there  is  a  probability  of  80%  that  a 
randomly  selected  presence  record  has  a  greater  predicted  value  than  a 
randomly selected absence (Pearson 2007; Wisz et al. 2008). The AUC value 
is calculating by measuring the area under the ROC curve, and ranges from 0 
to  1.  An AUC score of  1 indicates  a perfect  model  i.e.  perfect discrimination 
between  presences  and  absences;  a  model  with  AUC  of  0.5  indicates  a 
discriminating ability no better than random; an AUC value &lt;0.5 indicates the 
model performs worse than random, i.e. the model may fit the modelling data 
but it predicts badly (Elith et al. 2006; Elith &amp; Leathwick 2007; Pearson 2007; 
Franklin  2009).  A  model  of  AUC  score  of  0.5  to  0.7  has  been  used  as 
indication  of  poor  performance,  0.7  to  0.9  is  moderate,  and  &gt;0.9  is  high 
(Franklin  2009).  The  AUC  is  not  influenced  by  species  prevalence,  and 
therefore  is  reliable  for  model  comparisons  (Phillips  et  al.  2006;  Franklin 
2009); such comparisons are valid only between models and sample sizes of 
the same species and study area (Wisz et al. 2008). 
 
Fig. 1: Area under curve (AUC)

  In  cases  where  only  presence  data  are  available,  almost  all  the 
measures discussed above can be applied by testing the ability of the model 
to  discriminate  accurately  between  presence  and  background  (also  called 
pseudo-absence)  data,  although  they  should  be  interpreted  differently 
(Franklin 2009). In such cases, AUC, for example, could be interpreted as the 
probability of the model scoring a random presence site higher than a random 
pseudo-absence or background site (Franklin 2009). 
All  methods  defined  from  the  confusion  matrix  (including  kappa  and 
AUC), are flawed and are unsuitable to be used when only presence data are 
available (Boyce et al. 2002; Pearson et al. 2007). AUC, for example, is not an 
absolute  measure  and  is  sensitive  to  the  method  used  to  determine  the 
absence data during the evaluation (Wisz et al. 2008) and may often give poor 
model performance because of low classification success (Boyce et al. 2002). 
Its  value  tend  to  be  higher  for  species  with  narrower  ranges  relative  to  the 
study area, which does not necessarily mean that the model is better (Phillips 
&amp;  AT&amp;T  Research  2011).  In  statistical  modelling  the  usual  method  of 
assessing the model fit is the Akaike Information Criterion, or AIC. This strikes 
a balance  between fitting  the data  as  well as possible (which can  always be 
improved by using more predictor variables), and parismony (which is taken to 
mean the fewest number of predictors). It is used to  arrive  at  the  best set  of 
predictors  from  a  panel  of  possibilities,  refining  an  individual  model,  but 
comparing  models  with  different  response  variables  cannot  be  done.  Thus 
here the use of AIC is not very useful. 
 
Maximum entropy modelling (Maxent) 
Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method for making inferences 
or predictions from incomplete information (Phillips et al. 2006; Baldwin 2009). 
It estimates the most uniform distribution (maximum entropy) subject to a set 
of  constraints  that  represent  our  incomplete  information  about  the  target 
distribution  (Phillips  et  al.  2006).  It  is  being  applied  in  a  variety  of  fields 
including  finance  and  astronomy  (Franklin  2009).  Since  2004  it  has  been 
applied  extensively  to  model  species  distributions  because  it  shows  high 
predictive accuracy and enjoys several additional attractive properties (Phillips 
- 14 - 
&amp;  Dudik  2008;  Franklin  2009).  It  has  been  used  in  a  variety  of  applications 
including  predicting  species  richness  (Graham  &amp;  Hijmans  2006;  Pineda  &amp; 
Lobo  2009),  invasive  species  (Ficetola  et  al.  2007;  Ward  2007),  estimating 
species extent of occurrence (Sergio et al. 2007), and the quality of protection 
of rare species (DeMatteo &amp; Loiselle 2008; Thorn et al. 2009). 
  Maxent can produce three output formats (raw, cumulative and logistic), 
but  the  logistic  format  improves  model  calibration  and  so  is  highly 
recommended over the two other formats: it provides an estimate of probability 
of  presence  as  predicted  by  the  environmental  variables,  and  thus  large 
differences in the values correspond to large differences  in habitat suitability 
(Phillips  &amp;  Dudik  2008;  Baldwin  2009).  The  logistic  format  provides  output 
values  ranged  from  0  to  1  and  is  easier  to  interpret  when  projected  to 
Geographic  Information  System  (GIS)  (Baldwin 2009).  All the  three types  of 
the  output  formats  are  monotonically  related  but  are  scaled  differently  and 
have different interpretations (Phillips &amp; AT&amp;T Research 2011);  all  pixels  will 
be ranked in the same order, resulting in identical performance when a rank-
based statistic is used (e.g. AUC), but will vary in predictive performance when 
using  a  measure  that  depends  on  the  actual  output  value  (e.g.  Pearsonâs 
correlation) (Phillips &amp; Dudik 2008; Baldwin 2009). 
  Several  studies  have  shown  that  Maxent  performs  well in comparison 
with  alternative  algorithms  and shows  higher predictive  accuracy  (Elith  et  al. 
2006; Hernandez et al. 2006; Pearson et al. 2007; Wisz et al. 2008; Franklin 
2009;  Pineda  &amp;  Lobo  2009).  According  to  Phillips  et  al.  (2006),  the  main 
advantages  of  Maxent  are  that  it  requires  only  presence  records  along  with 
predictor variables for the whole study area; it is able to use both continuous 
and  categorical  environmental  data  (Baldwin  2009);  it  can  fit  interactions 
between  different  predictor  variables;  it  is  based  on  a concise  mathematical 
definition;  over-fitting  can  be  avoided  by  using  standard  methods  (called 
regularization);  prediction  output  is  continuous;  and it  can  also  be  applied to 
presence/absence data by using conditional models. Maxent has been shown 
to be very robust to small numbers of training records and outperforms other 
algorithms when using a relatively small number of occurrence records (Wisz 
et  al.  2008;  Franklin  2009).  It  has  been  reported  as  producing  accurate 
predictions  using  as  few  as  20-30 records  (Feeley  &amp;  Silman  2011);  in  some 
- 15 - 
cases as few as five records can calibrate a model, but such models should be 
interpreted  with  great  caution  and  be  used  to  point  out  areas  where  future 
surveys  should  focus  (Baldwin  2009).  It  is  also  robust  against  moderate 
location errors accompanying species records, outperforming other algorithms 
(Graham et al. 2008). In some studies that compare the accuracy of different 
algorithms,  Maxent  was  shown  to  outperform  GARP,  especially  with  small 
sample sizes (Franklin 2009). In Elith et al. (2006) comprehensive  study  that 
compares  the  accuracy  of  a  large  number  of  presence-only  algorithms, 
Maxent  was  among the top performers  and showed high predictive accuracy 
(Franklin  2009).  It  also  outperformed  GLM  and  GAM  when  applied  to 
presence/background  data,  and  was  much  better  than  BIOCLIM  (Franklin 
2009). 
  Maxent has some drawbacks, however. It is not as mature a statistical 
method  as  GLM  and  GAM,  and  hence  special-purpose  software  is  required 
because  it  is  not  available  in  standard  statistical  packages  (Phillips  et  al. 
2006). Maxent is disposed to overfitting (matching the input data too closely), 
yielding  predicted  distributions  with  high  values  clumped  around  the 
occurrence  points.  This  has  a  detrimental  effect  on  model  performance 
(Phillips  &amp;  Dudik  2008;  Baldwin  2009).  In  order  to  surmount  this  issue,  a 
number  of âregularizationâ parameters have  been added to recent  versions  of 
Maxent  (Phillips  &amp;  Dudik  2008;  Baldwin  2009).  There  are  various  different 
settings that can be adjusted by the modeller, but recent studies have shown 
that  the  default  settings  work  perfectly  well  for  a  wide  range  of  species, 
environmental  conditions,  number  of  available  records  and  level  of  sample 
bias,  achieving  a  performance  just  as  good  as  the  models  that  result  from 
adjusted settings (Phillips &amp; Dudik 2008; Baldwin 2009). 
  It  is  important  to  know  how  each  variable  influences  the  model 
predictions,  and  which  has  the  greatest  influence  (Baldwin  2009).  Maxent 
provides  two  measures  of  variable  importance.  First,  it  estimates  the 
contribution of each variable using either: percent contribution and permutation 
importance (Table 4). Percent contribution shows how each variable contribute 
to the model, based on the particular path selected by the algorithm to get the 
optimal solution (different algorithms can get the same solution using different 
paths,  resulting  in  having  different  percent  contribution  values)  (Phillips  &amp; 
- 16 - 
AT&amp;T  Research  2011).  Permutation  importance  depends  only  on  the  final 
model,  not the path  used to get it. This  is calculated by randomly  permuting 
variable  values  among  presence  and  background  points  and  measuring  the 
resulting decline in training AUC, high AUC decline indicates high dependency 
of  the  model  of  that  variable (Phillips  &amp;  AT&amp;T  Research  2011).  Permutation 
importance is more favourable to estimate variables importance as it does not 
depend on the path used by the algorithm (Songer et al. 2012); although both 
values should be interpreted with caution because of collinearity - when using 
strongly  correlated  environmental  variables,  a  greater  importance  can  easily 
be attributed to one of two or more highly correlated variables (Baldwin 2009; 
Phillips  &amp;  AT&amp;T  Research 2011).  The  second  approach is  the  jackknife  test 
(Fig. 2), done by repeatedly running the model excluding each variable in turn, 
as  well  as  models  using  each  variable  in isolation  and  all  variables  together 
(Baldwin 2009; Phillips &amp; AT&amp;T Research 2011). This provides information on 
the relative strength  of  each variable, how  accurately each is  able  to  explain 
the distribution and how much unique information is provided by it (Yost et al. 
2008;  Baldwin 2009).  Maxent  also  provides  response  curves  describing  how 
each  variable  influences  the  probability  of  occurrence,  keeping  all  other 
variables  constant  at  their  average  value  (Baldwin  2009).  These  response 
curves  are  also  highly  affected  by  strong  collinearity  among  predictors 
(Baldwin 2009) (Fig. 3).

Climate change and biodiversity 
Over  the  last  century,  changes  of  Earthâs  climate  have  been  recorded, 
including  warmer  temperatures  (0.6  Â°C  increase  over  the  20
th
  century) 
accompanied  with  altered  geographical  and  seasonal  distribution  of 
precipitation (AraÃºjo &amp; Rahbek 2006; Thuiller 2007; Alkemade et al. 2011). It is 
expected  that  climate  will  undergo  a  continuous  increase  in  temperature  of 
between  1  and  6  Â°C  during  the  21
st
  century  (Thuiller  2007;  Alkemade  et  al. 
2011). 
There is a widespread agreement that climate change has high impact 
on  the  survival  of  ecological  communities  and  individuals  (Suarez  &amp;  Tsutsui 
2004;  Alkemade  et  al.  2011);  and  that  biodiversity  is  continually  being 
transformed  in  response  to  it  (Hannah  et  al.  2005).  Even  though  recorded 
effects  of  climate  change  on  biodiversity  seem  to  be  generally  slower  than 
other factors, it is predicted that its effects will become increasingly prominent 
over the next 50 years and beyond (Thuiller 2007). The combination of habitat 
fragmentation  and  climate  change  is  the  most  threatening  aspect  of  climate 
change  impacts  on  biodiversity  and  species  conservation  (Hannah  et  al. 
2005). As climate changes, species (or populations) will be able to survive in 
novel environments if the new environmental conditions are within the speciesâ 
fundamental niches, or if species are able to adapt to these conditions if they 
are  outside  of  its  fundamental  niche  (MartÃ­nez-Meyer  2005).  In  other  words, 
the ability of a species to respond to climate change will be dependent on its 
ability to track climate changes, colonize new areas and modify its physiology 
and  seasonal  behavior  to  adapt  to  novel  environmental  conditions  (Thuiller 
2007). 
Responses  of  different  species  to climate  change can  be categorized 
into  three  non-exclusive  axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range),  and 
âselfâ  (e.g.  physiology)  (Bellard  et  al.  2012).  Climate  change  has  been 
implicated in the last 40 years as the main cause for speciesâ distribution shifts 
and  the  extinction  (Thomas  et  al.  2004),  with  a  particularly  strong  impact  on 
butterflies,  birds  and  species  at  high  altitude  (Hannah  2011).  Some  climate 
change  model  forecasts  claim  that  15-37%  of  the  current  species  are 
committed  to  extinction  by  2050  (without  taking  in  consideration  biological 
factors;  e.g.  competition  and  evolutionary  history)  (Thuiller  2007).  Expected 
- 19 - 
species range shifts are generally polewards or towards higher altitudes, with 
each  temperature  increase  of  1 Â°C  predicted  to cause  a move  of  ecological 
zone by 160 km polewards or 0.16 km higher altitude (Thuiller 2007). Over the 
past  50  years,  the  range  of  terrestrial  plants  and  animals  in  the  northern 
hemisphere  has  been  shifted  on  average  by  6.1  km  northward  (or  6.1  m 
upwards)  each decade,  causing remarkable  increases  in  species  diversity  in 
some places in Europe over the last century (Thuiller 2007). Many European 
birds  and  butterflies,  for  example,  have  shifted  their  distributions  northwards 
by about 20 km and 150 km respectively from 1970 to 1990 (Alkemade et al. 
2011).  Range  shifts  of  flowering  plants  and pollinating  insect  species  due  to 
climate  change  will  cause  possible  mismatches  between  plant  and  pollinator 
populations; coupled with increased extinction risks to either of them, this will 
result in changes to insect-pollinator networks (Bellard et al. 2012), potentially 
causing  dramatic  changes  to  ecosystem  services.  Other  interspecific 
relationships  are  also  susceptible  to  such  modifications  (competition, 
predation,  parasitism  and  mutualism)  which  will  modify  community  structure 
and ecosystem functions (Bellard et al. 2012). Range shifts of introduced pest 
and pathogenic species due to climate change may have even more dramatic 
impacts on ecosystems, conservation and human life (Hannah 2011). Climate 
change has also resulted in changes to the timing of seasonal events of some 
species  e.g.  earlier  egg-laying  for  birds  (Crick  et  al.  1997;  Hughes  2000; 
Suarez &amp; Tsutsui 2004), bird migration, reproduction, planting and harvesting, 
fruiting and flowering times (Ibanez et al. 2006; Parmesan 2006). 
Several  extinction  incidents  recorded  in  the  recent  past  have  been 
claimed  as  the  results  of  climate  change.  The  first  documented  extinction 
linked to climate change occurred in 1987 when the formerly common Golden 
Toad  (Bufo  periglenes)  from  Costa  Rica  disappeared  (Hannah  2011).  As  a 
result  of  increasing  temperature,  it  is  expected  that  species  turnover  will 
increase  and the  proportion  of  the  range  of  species  that  will  remain  suitable 
under climate change will decrease in all biomes (Alkemade et al. 2011). 
  Species  distribution  models  have  been  widely  used  to  estimate  the 
potential  impacts  of climate change  on species distributions  and ecosystems 
(Coetzee  et  al.  2009;  Franklin  2009)  and  predict  potential  future  extinction 
risks. Once a model has been calibrated for current climate conditions, it can 
- 20 - 
be  projected  to  predict  the  potential  distributions  at  different  time  periods  (in 
the  future  or  the  past)  by  using  information  on  predicted  climates,  or  to 
different study areas in order to assess the potential locations where invasions 
are  more  likely  to  establish  (Franklin  2009).  This  helps  to  manage  species 
facing  possible future threats  by  identifying biological  corridors  for  dispersal, 
determining  sites  for  re-introduction  and  areas  requires  more  protection 
measures  (Thuiller  2007).  Several  studies  have  used  species  distribution 
models  to  show  the  effect  of  climate  change  on  the  whole  fauna  and  flora; 
such  predictions  are  challenging  tasks  because  this  involves  sources  of 
uncertainty:  in  the  data,  the  resolution,  which  algorithm  is  used  (different 
algorithms  may  produce  very  different  future  projections  even  if  they  give 
similar present-day models (MartÃ­nez-Meyer 2005)), and the global circulation 
model  (GCM)  used  to  create  predicted  climate  scenarios  (Carvalho  et  al. 
2010;  Guisan  &amp;  Rahbek  2011).  Validation  of  the  projected  results  is 
problematic,  because  predictions  are  made  for  events  that  have  not  yet 
occurred  (AraÃºjo  &amp;  Pearson  2005).  Validation  can  be  done  by  projecting 
recent  past  distributions  of  some  species  to  current  conditions,  using  new 
records  as  independent  data  for  evaluation,  or  by  projecting  current 
distributions  back  to  the  distant  past  (e.g.  Pleistocene  climates)  and  using 
fossil  records  as  independent  data  for  evaluation  (AraÃºjo  &amp;  Pearson  2005; 
Thuiller  2007).  In  most  cases,  the  availability  of  such  data  is  very  limited  to 
certain  geographical  areas  or  taxonomic  groups.  For  these  reasons,  results 
from such projection studies should be treated with great caution. 
It is  assumed  by  most  distribution models (projected in time  or space) 
that  the  climate  conditions  in  current  and  projected  models  are  analogous. 
When this assumption is violated, by extrapolating to conditions beyond those 
of  the  training  data  (non-analogous  climates),  inaccuracies  can  result,  with 
either over-prediction or under-prediction (Fitzpatrick et al. 2008; Richmond et 
al. 2010). A possible solution is to limit predictions in areas with novel climate 
conditions by applying so-called âclampingâ (Richmond et al. 2010). Clamping 
has become available in recent versions of Maxent, allowing the identification 
of the degree of uncertainty in projected models and showing areas where the 
model is less reliable because of extrapolation (RÃ¶dder et al. 2009; Holcombe 
et al. 2010). Using clamping in Maxent results in a constant response outside 
- 21 - 
the  maximum  and  minimum  limits  of  the  training  data,  by  constraining  the 
climate to remain at the limits of the training data (Phillips et al. 2006; Elith et 
al. 2010; Elith et al. 2011).  
  Forecast  results  using  different  model  algorithms  can  vary  quite  a  lot: 
fundamentally these models depend on correlations between environment and 
distribution,  and  thus  are  dependent  on  the  data  and  the  mathematical 
functions  used  to  predict  species  distributions  (AraÃºjo  &amp;  New  2007).  In 
addition,  studies  have  shown  that  results  derived  from  different  species 
distribution modelling methods are not equally reliable for all species and that 
the best performing model is not always the same for all species (Luoto et al. 
2005;  Grenouillet  et  al.  2011).  To  reduce  the  effect  of  inter-model  variation, 
some  researchers  recommend  the  simultaneous  use  of  different  prediction 
methods  (and  climate  change  models  and  emission  scenarios)  within  a 
consensus  modelling  framework  (ensemble  or  consensus  modelling),  which 
they  claim  produces  more  robust  inference  and  prediction  (AraÃºjo  &amp;  New 
2007; Coetzee et al. 2009; Grenouillet et al. 2011; Yen et al. 2011). The term 
consensus refers to  an  agreement  of different model outputs (Marmion  et al. 
2009). Using ensemble modelling helps to reduce the predictive uncertainty of 
a  single  model  and  potentially  to  improve  the  robustness  of  the  projections 
(AraÃºjo  &amp; New  2007; Grenouillet et  al. 2011). It may  also  help to reduce the 
effect of model uncertainty and improve predictions for rare species (Guisan &amp; 
Rahbek  2011).  Ensemble  modelling  has  been  recently  used  in  broad-scale 
conservation  studies,  especially  to  check  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on 
different species (Marmion et al. 2009). BIOMOD (Thuiller et al. 2009) is one 
of  the  most-used  platforms  for  ensemble  modelling.  It  is  a  free  Cran-R  (R 
Development  Core  Team  2012)  package  that  enables  users  to  perform 
species  distribution  models  using  several  modelling  techniques  (including 
Maxent in most recent versions) and testing methods, including projecting the 
models into predicted future environmental conditions (Thuiller et al. 2009). 
 
Relevance to Egypt 
Predicted  impacts  of  climate  change  on  Egypt  include  the  raising  of  the  sea 
level  (which  will  affect  people  living  in Nile  Delta  and coastal  areas  in  Egypt 
- 22 - 
and  also  will  make  high  percentage  of  Egypt  flora  and  fauna  vulnerable  to 
extinction), changes in the distribution of vector-borne infectious diseases, and 
reduction  in the productivity  of  major crops (Parry  et al.  2007; Tolba &amp; Saab 
2009).  It  also  predicted  that  Egypt  will  be  vulnerable  to  water  stress  and 
increase  of  water  requirements,  uncertainty  of  Nile  flow,  and  increase  in 
irrigation demand under climate change (Parry et al. 2007). The water issue is 
a serious problem facing Egypt in the future because the country is mostly arid 
and depends on the Nile as the main source of drinking and irrigation water.  
  Tourism,  one  of  the  main  sources  of  Egypt  National  Income,  is  also 
predicted to be affected in the future by climate change (Tolba &amp; Saab 2009). 
The  number  of  tourists  coming  to  Egyptâs  coasts  each  year  is  expected  to 
decline  because  of  the  potential  impact  of  climate  change  on  coral  reefs. 
Worldwide,  almost  all  coral  reefs  have  been  affected  by  climate-change-
induced coral bleaching at one time or another (Hannah 2011). Corals depend 
on  a  certain  kind  of  algae  (zooxanthellae),  using  the  nutrients  they  produce 
while providing the algae with physical support, protection and maintenance in 
adequate level  of sunlight for photosynthesis (Hannah 2011). When exposed 
to  high  water  temperatures  (more  than  1  or  2Â°  C  rise  in  sea  surface 
temperature above normal summer maximal temperatures for a period longer 
than  3â5  weeks),  corals  expel  the  algae,  resulting  in  loss  of  coral  color 
(Hannah  et  al.  2005;  Hannah  2011).  Beside  its  conservation  implications, 
declines  in  the  number  of  tourists  will  have  great  impact  on  Egypt  National 
Income  and  a  relatively  high  proportion  of  Egyptians  working  in  tourism  will 
suffer.  
  Climate  change  will  potentially  affect  biodiversity  and  species 
composition of Egypt ecosystems (Tolba &amp; Saab 2009), although not enough 
studies or data are available on this (see below). It is predicted that Egypt will 
suffer from global changes in the distribution of flowering plants and pollinating 
insects due to climate change, which are predicted to cause dramatic declines 
in  the  ecosystem  services  they  provide.  We  do  have  an  estimate  of  the 
potential costs of such declines: the annual cost of losing Egyptian pollinators 
to the Egyptian National Income would be approximately L.E. 13.5 billion ($2.4 
billion, 3.3% of the 2003 GDP) (Brading et al. 2009).

  Only a handful of studies have been conducted with the use of species 
distribution  modelling  techniques  to  predict  the  potential  distribution  of 
Egyptian fauna and the potential impacts of climate chance on them: there are 
no such  published  studies  on  Egyptian  flora.  This  may  be  because that  the 
models  are  relatively  new  and  the  availability  of  biodiversity  data  records  of 
Egyptian  fauna  and  flora  are not  well  organized  and  sparse.  Gilbert  &amp;  Zalat 
(2008); Basuony et al. (2010), the main two publication of the BioMAP project 
(see:  http://biomapegypt.org),  discussed  the  distribution  of  each  Egyptian 
butterfly and mammal species respectively. In these two books, data on each 
species  were  collated  from  available  sources  and  an  actual  and  predicted 
distribution map for each species were provided (using Maxent); each species 
was  also assessed  according to the IUCN  guidelines  and criteria.  In another 
study, El Alqamy et al. (2010) used Maxent to predict the potential distribution 
of  the  Nubian  Ibex  (Capra  nubiana)  in  South  Sinai,  and  showed  that  the 
presence  of  water  was  the  environmental  factor  most  influential  in  their 
distribution in South Sinai. 
Three studies have discussed the effect of climate change on Egyptian 
species.  Hoyle  &amp;  James  (2005)  used  an  occupancy  model  (a  type  of 
population viability analysis) to assess the potential impacts of global warming 
on  the  worldâs  smallest  butterfly,  the  Sinai  Baton  Blue  (Pseudophilotes 
sinaicus).  Just  two  recent  studies  have  used  species  distribution  models  to 
assess the effect of climate change on Egypt biodiversity. Soultan (2011) used 
Maxent  to  test  the  potential  impact  of  climate  change  on  the  distribution  of 
Egyptian  antelopes  (Barbary  sheep  Ammotragus  lervia,  Nubian  ibex  Capra 
nubiana, Dorcas gazelle Gazella dorcas, and Slender-horned gazelle Gazella 
leptoceros)  using  the  A2  and  B2  emission  scenarios  of  a Global  Circulation 
Models.  Leach  (2011)  discussed  the  effect  of  climate  change  on  Egyptian 
butterflies  and  mammals  (using  Maxent  algorithm  and  A2  and  B2  emission 
scenarios  of  a  different  Global  Circulation  Models),  and  considered  the 
effectiveness  of  the  Protected  Area  network  in  Egypt  in  conserving  Egypt 
biodiversity  under  current  and  future  climates  (using  Zonation  software).  No 
studies  have  been  published  on  the  use  of  species  distribution  models  to 
predict the potential distribution of Egyptian reptiles - the topic of this study.

ï§  assess the priority areas for conservation of Egyptian reptiles; 
ï§  perform  a  gap  analysis  to  show  the  effectiveness  of  Egyptâs  Protected 
Areas network to conserve reptiles.

Methods 
 
Study area â Egypt 
Egypt  is  located  at  the  north  eastern  part  of  the  continent  of  Africa;  it  is 
situated  between  latitudes  22Â°  to  32Â°  N  and  longitudes  24Â°  to  37Â°  E.  It 
occupies an area of a little more than 1,000 kilometers square (1 million km
2
), 
constituting about 3 per cent  of Africa (Zahran &amp; Willis 2009 - See  Fig. 4 for 
the political boundaries of Egypt showing the main locations discussed in this 
study).  Geographically,  it  can  be  divided  into  four  units:  the  Nile  Valley  and 
Delta,  Western  Desert,  Eastern  Desert,  and  Sinai.  Most  of  Egyptâs  human 
population lives around the Nile and Delta because of the restricted availability 
of water and food elsewhere, which leaves a large proportion of Egyptâs land 
as  desolate  desert.  Relatively  small  settlements  are  sparsely  distributed  in 
Western Desert oases, the Red Sea coast, and Sinai. Egypt is one of if not the 
most arid country in the world; average annual rainfall across Egypt is just 10 
mm with a maximum of 200 mm at the Mediterranean coast (Zahran &amp; Willis 
2009). There are 30 Protected Areas in Egypt, compromising about 15% of the 
total area of Egypt (Fig. 5). 
 
Study species â Egyptian reptiles 
According to (Baha El Din 2006a), the most recent comprehensive publication 
on  the  Egyptian  herpetofauna,  the  contemporary  Egyptian  reptiles  include  at 
least 109 species: 61 lizards, 39 snakes, 1 crocodile, 7 turtles and a tortoise; 
in  addition  there is  a  recently  separated species,  Acanthodactylus  aegyptius 
(Baha El Din 2007). Data on species distribution were compiled from various 
different  sources.  The  main  source  was  records  extracted  from  the BioMAP 
project database [Biodiversity Monitoring and Assessment Project 2004-2008; 
see:  http://www.biomapegypt.org/];  one  of  BioMAPâs  main  aims  was  to 
develop  a comprehensive  database  of  existing  Egyptian  biodiversity  records 
derived  mainly  from  international  museum  records,  recent  literature,  and 
personal  collections.  For  Egyptian  reptiles,  the  collections  were  mainly  from 
two  well-known  Egyptian  herpetologists,  Dr.  Sherif  Baha  El  Din  and  Dr. 
- 26 - 
Mostafa  Saleh.  In  addition  to  BioMAP  database  records,  I  included  some 
further records from the sparse literature (a full list  of the  published literature 
used  is  given  in  Appendix  1).  I  also  involved  my  personal  sightings  from 
fieldwork surveys  done  in Sinai,  Gebel  Elba,  Nile Delta,  and  Eastern  desert 
(2005-2011). All these records were gathered into one preliminary database. 
Records  were  then  assessed  based  on  various  criteria  (mainly 
taxonomic and geographic). Species taxonomy was revised according to latest 
taxonomic  findings  (Baha  El  Din  2006a),  and  records  with  invalid 
unrecognizable  taxonomy  were  deleted.  Some  records  came  from  outside 
Egypt  and some  non-Egyptian species  had  erroneously  been included in  the 
database. Records for marine or Nile species (Nile crocodile and Sea Turtles) 
were  also  excluded  from  the  database  because  the  lack  of  GIS  predictor 
layers  for  aquatic  environments  meant  that  these  species  could  not  be 
involved in species distribution modelling. 
For  recent  records  coming  with  global  positioning  systems  (GPS) 
receiver  coordinates,  sighting  coordinates  were  double-checked  to  avoid 
possible  uncertainties  over  the  coordinate  system  used  (Newbold  2009), 
errors  accompanied  with  transferring  information  from  GPS  devices  or  field 
sheets to electronic databases or with unintentional swapping between latitude 
and  longitude.  All  other  records  were  then  georeferenced  to  the  nearest  5 
decimal  places  (when  possible)  using  topographic  maps,  gazetteers,  and 
Google  EarthÂ®.  Records  with  vague  location  names  (e.g.  records  with  just 
Egypt, Eastern Desert, Western Desert, Sinai, South Sinai, etc.) could not be 
georeferenced  precisely  and  so  were  deleted  from  the  database.  Some 
locations  were  not  able  to  be  georeferenced,  i.e.  very  small  locations  or 
locations  with  local  names  that  could  not  be  identified  using  available 
topographic maps and gazetteers (e.g. small wadis or villages). These records 
were deleted from the database. 
All  valid  georeferenced  records  were  then  mapped  using 
ArcMap 10 (ESRI,  USA)  and  a  current  distribution  map  were  prepared  for 
each  species  (not  shown).  Current  species  distributions  were  then  checked 
and compared to those from (Baha El Din 2006a). Records from odd locations 
(outside the distribution range) were assigned as inaccurate and deleted from 
the database (especially for old museum records). 
- 27 - 
Only species recorded from 8 unique pixels or more (at the resolution of 
2.5  arc  minutes;  see  below)  were  processed  further  with  species  distribution 
models to avoid high  over-fitting  as  a result  of using  a very small number  of 
species  occurrences  with  Maxent  (Baldwin  2009).  Twenty-eight  terrestrial 
reptile species were excluded from this study on this basis (see Appendix 2). 
More records for these species are required in order to be able to assess their 
potential response to climate change, particularly urgent since many are either 
endemics/near-endemics  or  with  restricted  ranges.  This  results  in  having  a 
final  database  of  12,188  records  representing  75  species  (49  lizards,  25 
snakes, and 1 tortoise - the species list and number of valid records for each 
are given in Table 5). The collection dates of the records were found to range 
from 1821 to 2011, with an apparent increase in the recording effort from 1950 
onwards  (Fig.  6).  The  coverage  of  the  records  is  good,  covering  most  of 
Egyptâs landscape and habitats (Fig. 7a). Bias in recording effort (represented 
by the number of valid records) was checked across a 0.25Âº grid, showing high 
bias towards the main cities and populated areas (Fig. 7b). Unsurprisingly, the 
highest collection  effort  was found  around the  greater Cairo district, followed 
by  South  Sinai  (the  St  Katherine  area),  the  Alexandria  area,  some  areas 
around  Fayoum  and  Wadi  El-Natrun  and  small  patches  near  El-Arish  and 
Mersa Matruh. 
 
Environmental predictor variables  
Climate data for the  near past (1950-2000)  was downloaded from  WorldClim 
Global Climate Data v1.4 (release 3 - see: http://www.worldclim.org) (Hijmans 
et  al.  2005).  These  data  were  considered  to  indicate  the  current  climate 
conditions.  The  Worldclim  website  provides  a  set  of  global  environmental 
layers (at different resolutions) in the form of 19 climate variables (bio-layers: 
see  Table  6)  derived  from  precipitation  and  temperature  records.  Bio-layers 
were clipped to  the  boundaries  of  Egypt using Clip tool in ArcMap 10 (ESRI, 
USA). The resolution of 2.5 arc-minutes (~5 km square) was chosen to run the 
distribution  models  because  it  is  appropriate  to  the  level  of  uncertainty  that 
accompanies  the  museum  records  (which  form  the  majority  of  the  records), 
and because the climate data for Egypt were interpolated using relatively few 
weather stations  largely  concentrated  in  the  Nile Valley  and  Delta  (Newbold 
- 28 - 
2009 -  Fig.  8), creating more uncertainty. A special study  may  be  needed  to 
validate the reliability of bio-layers derived from relatively few weather stations 
in  species  distribution  modelling,  but  this  will  need  independent  field  data 
(MartÃ­nez-Meyer 2005). A further benefit of running the models at a resolution 
of 2.5 arc-minutes instead of the more detailed 30 arc-seconds is not only that 
this reduces run times and storage space, but it also is thought to minimise the 
effect of ignoring species interactions on modelled distributions, which can not 
be managed in correlative models: Pearson &amp; Dawson (2003) argued that the 
impact  of  biological  interactions  on  distribution  models  is  minimized  by 
constructing  models  at  macro-scales,  where  the  influence  of  environmental 
variables on species distributions dominate. 
Elevation  data  were  obtained  from  the  SRTM  Digital  Elevation 
Database  v4.1  [available  at:  http://www.cgiar-csi.org/data/elevation],  which  is 
available  in  tiles  covering  the  globe.  The  tiles  that  cover  Egypt  were 
downloaded  at  90-m  resolution,  merged  together  using  the  Mosaic  tool, 
clipped to the boundaries of Egypt, and rescaled to be of the same resolution 
of other layers (2.5 arc minutes) using ArcMap 10 (ESRI, USA). 
  An  Egyptian  geological  habitat  map  was  one  of  the  products  of  the 
BioMAP project (A. A. Hassan, unpublished data), and was used here. In this 
map, the habitat of Egypt is classified into 11 classes (sea, littoral coastal land, 
cultivated  land,  sand  dune,  wadi,  metamorphic  rock,  igneous  rock,  gravels, 
serir sand sheets, sabkhas  and sedimentary rocks) based  on  existing  maps, 
remote  sensing  and  extensive  ground-truthing  (Newbold  et  al.  2009a).  The 
layer was available in vector format, and was converted to ascii raster format 
at the same resolution of other variables (2.5 arc minutes). 
  The normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a remote-sensing 
product  indicating  the  greenness  of  vegetation;  it  is  used  to  monitor  the 
vegetation condition of the landscape, and to discriminate between vegetation 
and non-vegetation  areas. It has therefore  often  been used as  a correlate of 
faunal  species  occurrence  and  diversity  in  species  distribution  modelling 
(Leyequien  et  al.  2007;  Peterson  et  al.  2011),  including  studies  of  reptiles 
(Rashid 2007; Costa et al. 2010; Taheri 2010; de Pous et al. 2011; Wooten &amp; 
Gibbs 2012). In this study, NDVI data for seven years (from Jan 2004 to Dec 
2010)  were  downloaded  from  the  SPOT  Vegetation  website  (see: 
- 29 - 
http://free.vgt.vito.be/).  They  are  provided  as  10-day  synthetic  maps  at  a 
resolution  of 1 km,  and  a total  of 252 maps were  obtained representing data 
from  2004  to  2010.  The  maximum  and  minimum  value  of  each  pixel  was 
calculated across the full set of maps. Two layers were derived from and used 
as  predictors  in  the  models:  maximum  NDVI  value  (indicating  how  much 
vegetation  there  is  per  pixel),  and  the  difference  between  maximum  and 
minimum  NDVI  value  (indicating  the  degree  of  fluctuation  in  vegetation  per 
pixel).  The  layers  were  clipped  to  the  boundaries  of  Egypt,  and  re-scaled  to 
2.5 arc-minutes resolution. 
  In  order  to  reduce  the  negative  effect  of  having  high  correlations 
between  predictor  variables  on  model  performance  and  the  over-fitting 
resulting  from  using  many  variables,  the  Variance  Inflation  Factor  (VIF) 
statistic  was  calculated  among  the  continuous  variables  as  a  measure  of 
multicollinearity. The VIF statistic has  been widely  used (with other statistical 
alternatives)  as  a  measure  of  collinearity  between  continuous  variables  in 
order to  prune  predictors before use (Farren  et al. 2010; FernÃ¡ndez-Moya  et 
al. 2010; Bombi &amp; DâAmen 2011; Bombi et al. 2012).  
Four  bio-layers  were  excluded  prior  to  VIF  calculations  because  they 
show only minor variability in their values across Egypt (see Fig. 9) and hence 
do not provide valuable information to the models. The excluded layers were: 
Bio7 (temperature  annual range), Bio14 (precipitation  of driest month), Bio17 
(precipitation of driest quarter), and Bio18 (precipitation of warmest quarter). In 
variable  Bio14,  for  example,  almost  all  pixels  were  shown  to  have  0  value 
except just 5 pixels that have a value of 1 (as shown in Fig. 9). This explicitly 
reflects  how  arid  Egypt  is.  Using  these  variables  will  not  provide  useful 
information to the models and may just add extra noise, so they were excluded 
before calculating the VIF statistic.

All the rest of the continuous variables (altitude, NDVI maximum value, 
difference between NDVI maximum and minimum values, and 15 bio-layers â 
see: Table 7) were involved in the collinearity test. VIF calculations were done 
using R software v2.15 (&#39;car&#39; package - R Development Core Team 2012); the 
variable  with  the  highest  VIF  score  was  removed  first  and  new  VIF  values 
calculated  between  the  remaining  variables,  a  process  repeated  until  all 
yielded VIF values below 10. The resulting variables (the grey shaded rows in 
Table 7) were then used in the Maxent modelling.

To estimate the potential impact of climate change on Egypt biodiversity 
(represented here by reptiles), current distribution models were projected into 
the future. This was done for three time slices (2020, 2050, and 2080). Future 
climate data (IPCC 4th assessment data - IPCC 2007) were downloaded from 
the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture website (see http://www.ccafs-
climate.org/). In this study, four Global Circulation Models (GCMs) were used 
at each time slice to minimise the effect of model type and model calculation 
method  on  the  final  results,  giving  an  average  overall  trend  of  the  potential 
impacts  of  climate change  (i.e.  some  elements  of  ensemble  modelling).  The 
four  GCMs  used  were  the  Hadley  Centre  Coupled  Model,  version  3 
(HadCM3),  produced  by  the  Hadley  Centre  for  Climate  Prediction  and 
Research (UK), the second-generation coupled global climate model produced 
by  the  Canadian  Centre  for  Climate  Modelling  and  Analysis  (CGCM2-
- 38 - 
CCCma),  a  model  produced  by  the  Commonwealth  Scientific  and  Industrial 
Research Organization  in  Australia (CSIRO  Mk2)  and  a model  produced  by 
the  Japanese  Centre  for  Climate  System  Research  (NIES99).  These  GCMs 
have  been  frequently  used  in  species  distribution  modelling  studies  that 
involve climate change impacts on biodiversity (AraÃºjo et al. 2006; Mika et al. 
2008; Holt et al. 2009; RÃ¶dder 2009; RÃ¶dder &amp; Weinsheimer 2009; Buisson et 
al.  2010; Fouquet et al. 2010; Brito  et  al.  2011; Hu &amp; Jiang  2011;  Nori  et al. 
2011;  Sanchez  et  al.  2011;  Wilms  et  al.  2011).  In  this  study,  possible 
evolutionary  and/or  phenological  responses  to  climate  change  were  not 
considered,  so  I  assume  that  species  will  try  to  track  their  suitable  habitat 
(depending  on  dispersal  ability)  rather  than  accommodate  to  the  new 
conditions.  The  fossil  record  shows  little  evidence  of  species  evolutionary 
response  to  past  climate  changes;  during  the  Pleistocene  glaciation,  for 
example,  the  fauna  and  flora  were  subjected  to  climate  change  5-10  times 
stronger than that of the 20
th
 century, and the main response was to track the 
changed climate (Maiorano et al. 2011).  
For each GCM model and time slice, two emission scenarios (A2a and 
B2a) were used, derived from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC)  Special  Report:  these  are  the  most  commonly  used  scenarios  in 
climate-change  assessments  (Hannah  2011).  They  reflect  two  different 
assumptions  about  the  levels  of  CO 2   emissions,  linked  to  assumed 
demographic  changes  and  socio-economic  and  technological  developments 
(Marini et al. 2009). In the A2a scenario, it is assumed that CO 2  emission rate 
will  be  unrestrictedly  doubled  by  2050  (medium  to  high  emission  rates  - 
&#34;Business  as  usual&#34;  scenario)  due  to  a  highly  heterogeneous  future  world 
characterized  by  high  population  growth  rate,  increased  land-use  changes, 
and  not  much  technological  improvement;  while  in  the  B2a  scenario,  it  is 
assumed that CO 2  emission rates will remain unchanged or even decrease by 
2050  (medium  to  low  emission  rates  -  &#34;moderate&#34;  scenario)  due  to  an 
environmentally  conscious  future  world  characterized  by  slower  population 
growth rate and land-use changes, and more technological innovations (Sauer 
et al. 2011; Saupe et al. 2011; Taubmann et al. 2011). Sets of future climate 
layers  equivalent  to  those  used  in  the  current-distribution  models  were 
prepared  to  be  used  in  future  projections.  We  have  no  idea  how  NDVI  and 
- 39 - 
habitat variables will alter in the future, and so I assumed in the future models 
that these variables will not alter; a further predictor variable will also not alter, 
altitude. 
 
Species distribution modelling 
In this study, Maxent software v3.3.3k (Phillips et al. 2004; Phillips et al. 2006 -  
see:  http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/)  was  chosen  to  run  the 
models, for reasons explained above. Ten replicated runs with cross-validation 
were made for each species (except species distributed in less than 10 unique 
pixels  &#39;at  the  resolution  of  2.5  arc  minutes&#39;:  in  these  cases  the  number  of 
replicates  was  set  automatically  to  the  number  of  unique  points).  This  was 
done by randomly  dividing the records into  10% sections,  and then each run 
used 90% of the data (training), leaving 10% for testing. This was repeated ten 
times, each with a different 10% of the data for testing. This method gets the 
best use of all the data for validation, especially if there are not many records 
(Phillips  &amp;  AT&amp;T  Research  2011).  This  also  obtains  a  more  stable  model 
performance to estimate the potential distribution, and minimises the effect of 
possible errors and bias in species records.  The habitat map (categorical) and 
all  non-collinear  continuous  variables  (grey-shaded  rows  in  Table  7)  were 
used to  run  the  models.  The  mean  (Â±  SD)  AUC  values  of  the  ten  replicated 
runs are given in Table 9. 
Default  Maxent  settings  have  been  shown  to  have  the  potential  of 
achieving a performance as good as if they were tuned on the evaluation data 
itself  (Phillips  &amp;  Dudik  2008).  Default  settings  were  used  to run the models, 
with just one exception: the maximum number of iterations was set to 1000, to 
be  sure  of  allowing  the  algorithm  enough  time  to  converge  (Phillips  et  al. 
2006).  The  logistic  output  format  was  chosen,  i.e.  the  probability  of 
occurrence,  ranging  from  0  to  1.  From  the  cross-validation  runs,  ten  raster 
ASCII  files  were  produced  for  each  species,  together  with  the  overall  mean 
probability  distribution.  For  each  species,  the  most  influential  variable  was 
determined  as  the  variable  with  the  highest  mean  permutation  importance 
across  model  runs.  Mean  contribution  value  of  each  variable  across  all 
- 40 - 
species was also calculated to indicate the most influential variable across all 
Egyptian reptile species. 
In order to convert the Maxent probabilities of occurrence into predicted 
presence/absence (or, more precisely, suitable/non-suitable habitat), the form 
required  for  further  analyses,  the  10
th
-percentile  training  presence  threshold 
was  used  (following:  Pearson  et  al.  2007).  This  threshold  is  determined  by 
assuming  that  10%  of  the  training  points  which  have  the  lowest  predicted 
values  were  not  precisely  located,  either  because  they  were  erroneously 
georeferenced, are migrants, or are ephemeral populations (Morueta-Holme et 
al.  2010).  A  pixel  is  assigned  to  indicate  presence  (suitable)  if  it  has  a 
predicted  value  more than the lowest 10%  of the predicted  values  of training 
records. For each species, ten thresholded distribution maps were created by 
Maxent from the ten probability maps. Maxent does not automatically provide 
an  overall  presence/absence  map  for  each  species,  so  this  was  created 
manually  by  assigning presence  to  a  pixel  if  it  has  presence  values  in  more 
than  half  of  the  model  runs  (&gt;5  runs).  This  was  done  using  the  Raster 
Calculator tool in ArcMap 10 (ESRI, USA). 
  The  current  predicted  distributions  (750  model  runs  for  75  species) 
were then projected into the future to assess the potential impacts of climate 
change on Egyptian reptiles. This was done for three future time slices (2020, 
2050, and 2080), four GCM models (HadCM3, CCCma, CSIRO, and NIES99) 
and two emission scenarios (A2a and A2b); giving a total of 24 possible future 
projections. The average impact of different GCMs was calculated to see the 
overall  effect  of  climate  change  on  Egyptian  reptiles,  regardless  of  which 
model  was  used.  This  gave  a  total  of  six  mean  future  analysis  sets  (3 time 
slices X 2 emission scenarios). 
For each species, each current predicted distribution run was projected 
into the  future using  24  possible  future  projections;  this  produces  240  future 
projections  for  each  species  (10  replicated  runs  for  each  species  were 
projected into 24 possible future projections), overall 18,000 future projections 
for the 75 species. For each future projection, two map sets were created: the 
potential  future  probability  and  thresholded  (suitable/non-suitable) 
distributions.

As  for  current  predictions,  the means  of  ten  projected  replicated  runs 
was  calculated,  producing  24  possible  future  distributions  for  each  species. 
Thresholded  future  distributions  made  by  Maxent  were  based  on  the 
assumption  that  species  have  the  ability  to disperse freely to  newly  suitable 
areas, considered unrealistic for at least some species (Peterson et al. 2002). 
Giving  that information  on the  dispersal  ability of most reptile species is  very 
limited (Cadby et al. 2010; Edgar et al. 2010), two extreme assumptions were 
used in the analyses: unlimited dispersal and no-dispersal, to allow a full range 
of possible outcomes - both assumptions are commonly used in the literature. 
The  true  response  should  lie  somewhere  in  between,  depending  on  the 
speciesâ ability to track future climate change (Maiorano et al. 2011), although 
using  both  assumptions  and  ignoring  the  effect  of  biotic  interactions  on 
distributions  has been criticized (AraÃºjo  &amp; Peterson 2012). For the âunlimited 
dispersalâ  assumption,  species  were  assumed  to  have  the  ability  to  move  to 
newly  suitable  habitats  without  restriction  or  giving  attention  to  any  barriers. 
For the âno dispersalâ  assumption, species  were  assumed to be incapable  of 
moving  to  newly  suitable  areas:  if  the  current  occupied  area  became 
unsuitable  in the  future,  the  species  was  assumed  to  become  extinct  in  that 
area.  No  account  was  taken  of  any  interactions  among  species,  such  as 
competition  and  predation  (Peterson  et  al.  2002),  because  there  is  no 
information about any such interactions to guide the modelling. 
The average future thresholded distributions of replicated runs were not 
created  automatically  by  Maxent;  they  were  calculated  using  the  Raster 
Calculator and Reclassify tools in ArcMap 10 (ESRI, USA). For the unlimited-
dispersal assumption, future thresholded distribution maps were used directly 
to  calculate  the  average  future  thresholded  distributions;  each  pixel  was 
assigned as a presence (suitable) if it was predicted to be potentially suitable 
in more than half of the replicated runs (&gt;5); this resulted in having 24 potential 
future  thresholded  distribution  maps  for  each  species.  For  the  no-dispersal 
assumption, the resulting thresholded distribution maps were not directly used, 
but  were processed  first  using  ArcMap 10 (ESRI,  USA)  in  such  a  way  as  to 
assign a pixel to be a presence if it had presence value in both the current and 
future  projection.  The  mean  overall  thresholded  distributions  for  no-dispersal 
replicated runs were calculated as in the case of unlimited dispersal.  
- 42 - 
The mean future predictions of the four GCMs were calculated as well; 
this was done for both probability and thresholded distributions. For probability 
distributions,  a  mean  of  the  four  global  circulation  models  was  calculated, 
yielding  just  six  mean  future  probability  maps  (3  time  slices  X  2  emission 
scenarios).  Thresholded  distributions  were  done  using  both  dispersal 
assumptions: a pixel was assigned to be potentially suitable if it had a value of 
presence  in  more  than  two  GCMs,  this  gave  six  overall  thresholded  future 
projections per species (for each of unlimited and no dispersal assumptions). 
 
Comparisons across species 
Current  and  future  predicted  species  richness  maps  were  calculated  in  two 
different  ways:  first,  by  simply  adding  together  the  average  probability 
distribution  maps  of  all  species  (assuming  future  unlimited  dispersal);  and 
second, by adding together the thresholded distribution maps (assuming future 
unlimited-  and  no-dispersal  assumptions).  For  current  species  richness,  two 
maps were created using either probability or thresholded distributions. Future 
species  richness  maps  were  calculated  for  each  of  the  24  possible  future 
projections,  using  either  probability  (unlimited  dispersal)  or  thresholded 
(unlimited and no dispersal) distributions. The overall means of future species 
richness  maps  across  the  four  GCMs  were  also  calculated  using  either 
probability  (unlimited  dispersal)  or  thresholded  (unlimited  and  no-dispersal) 
distributions. 
  Future  potential  changes  in  species  richness  were  also  calculated  by 
subtracting current species-richness from future species-richness maps. This 
does  not  take  into  consideration  the  potential  future  changes  in  species 
composition,  but  just  gives  an  indication  of  which  areas  will  have  an  altered 
(increased  or  decreased)  numbers  of  species.  This  resulted  in  having  24 
species  richness  changes  maps  either  using  either  probability  distributions 
(unlimited  dispersal)  or  thresholded  distributions  (either  unlimited  or  no-
dispersal). I calculated the average future changes in species richness across 
the four GCMs. 
  Gains  and  losses  in future species  distributions  were calculated using 
current  and  future  thresholded  distributions.  The  current  thresholded 
- 43 - 
distribution  of  each  species  was  reclassified  (using  the  Reclassify  tool  in 
ArcMap 10),  giving  a  value  of  3 to  presence  pixels  and  0 to  absence  pixels. 
For each species, values of every possible future thresholded distribution were 
added. In the resulting map, a pixel with a value of 4 indicated that this pixel 
was  maintained  suitable  in  the  future;  0  indicated  that  this  pixel  was 
maintained unsuitable in the future; 3 indicated that the pixel lost its suitability 
for the species in this  area (unlimited  and no dispersal);  and 1 indicated that 
the pixel gained suitability for this species (unlimited dispersal) (Fig. 10). Gains 
and losses for  each species  were exported separately to new GIS  files. The 
losses  across  all the  24 future  potential distributions  across  all species  were 
added together into a species loss map showing which areas are predicted to 
suffer  most  in  losing  species  (unlimited  and  no-dispersal).  The  data  can  be 
expressed as a percentage of the species richness of a pixel. The same was 
carried out performed for gains in suitability to produce a species gain map to 
showing which areas are predicted to gain much species (unlimited dispersal), 
which can be interpretable as potential refugee for the reptile species. A mean 
value  across  GCMs  of  total  lost  or  gained  suitability  maps  were  also 
calculated.

Fig. 10:  Calculation of future species gain or lost areas 
 
 
Species  turnover,  an  index  of  dissimilarity  between current  and future 
species  composition  (Thuiller  2004)  was  calculated.  It  is  defined  as  the  net 
- 44 - 
change  in  the  number  of  species  in  a  particular  area  (Broennimann  et  al. 
2006).  Species  turnover  is  often  considered  a  good  measure  of  community 
composition  change,  ecosystem  disturbance  and  the  potential  impacts  of 
climate  change  from  regional  to  continental  scales  (Thuiller  2004; 
Broennimann  et  al.  2006).  Areas  with  small  turnover  values  (close  to  0) 
indicate  that  the  species  assemblage  at  these  areas  is  predicted  to  remain 
unchanged  in  the  future  (no  species  loss  or  gain);  while  areas  with  a  high 
turnover values (close to  100) indicate that the species  assemblage  at these 
areas  is  predicted  to  be  completely  different  in  the  future  (i.e.  all  species 
occupying  the  area  are  predicted  to  be  lost/replaced  in  the  future)  (Thuiller 
2004;  Broennimann  et  al.  2006).  For  each  future  projection,  and  assuming 
both dispersal assumptions, species turnover was calculated as the following 
(following: Peterson et al. 2002; Thuiller et al. 2005; Broennimann et al. 2006): 
                 (unlimited dispersal) = 100 â  
   +   
   +   
 
   
                 (no dispersal) = 100 â 
  
  
 
 
Where  SL  is  the  number  of  potentially  lost  species,  SG  is  the  number  of 
potentially gained species, and SR is the current species richness. 
 
In  order  to  assess  the  future  extinction  risk  of  Egyptian  reptiles  as  a 
result  of  climate  change,  and  to determine  which species  may  require more 
protection  in  the  future,  species  range  changes  were  calculated:  the 
percentage  loss  (or  gain)  in  suitable  habitats  (unlimited-  and  no-dispersal 
assumptions). This  was calculated by counting the number of suitable pixels 
for  each  species  in  current  and  future  maps,  and  calculating  the  average 
percentage  of loss (or gain) in the number of pixels. Each species was then 
classified  into  one  of  the following categories  (at  each  of  24  possible  future 
projections and a mean classification among different GCMs): Extinct (loss of 
the  entire  suitable  habitat  -  100%),  Critically  Endangered  (loss  &gt;80%), 
Endangered  (loss  50-80%),  Vulnerable  (loss  30-50%),  Least  Concern  (loss 
&lt;30%), gain 1 (gain &lt;30%), gain 2 (gain 30-50%), gain 3 (gain 50-80%), gain 
- 45 - 
4 (gain 80-100%),  and gain 5 (gain &gt;100) (Modified from: Thuiller et al. 2005; 
Levinsky et al. 2007; Fitzpatrick et al. 2008). 
  Egyptian  reptile  species  were  classified  according  to  their  world 
distribution to reflect Egyptâs responsibility on their conservation; this was done 
following  (Gilbert  &amp;  Zalat  2008).  The  different  classes  are:  widespread  (the 
species  exists  in  more  than  one  continent  and  more  than  one  ecological 
habitat);  narrow  (the  species  exists  in  six  or  more  countries  in  a  consistent 
band);  restricted  (the  species  exists  in  only  3-5 nearly  connected  countries); 
near-endemic (the species  exists  only  in Egypt  and  a  maximum of  other two 
adjacent  countries);  and  endemic  (the  species  is  only recorded from  Egypt). 
Species  world  distribution  was  roughly  determined  using  online  databases 
(e.g.  www.iucnredlist.org,  www.catalogueoflife.org,  and  www.reptile-
database.org) and also (Baha El Din 2006a). 
Distribution patterns  within Egypt  were determined following (Gilbert &amp; 
Zalat  2008). This was done based  on  the number  of  eco-regions from  which 
each species has been recorded. Egyptâs eco-regions were defined by (Boulos 
1999-2006),  who  divided  the  country  into  eight  eco-regions:  Nile  Valley, 
Oases, Mediterranean strip, Eastern Desert, Western Desert, Red Sea coast, 
Gebel  Elba,  and  Sinai.  Species  were  classified  into  three  categories: 
widespread (recorded from four  or more  eco-regions), narrow (recorded from 
two or  three  eco-regions)  and localized (recorded from  only  one  eco-region). 
The  number  of  eco-regions  occupied  by  each species  was  determined using 
visual interpretations of species distributions across the different eco-regions. 
Neither the global nor national distribution classification is a fixed measure, but 
depends on visual interpretation and personal opinion. 
  The analyses weighted species using their Red List conservation status 
in  Egypt  according  to  IUCN  guideline  and  categories  (IUCN  Standards  and 
Petitions  Subcommittee  2010).  Incomplete  IUCN  assessments  were 
performed using only information derived from distribution records. As required 
by  IUCN,  these  classifications  involve  the  calculation  of  various  measures: 
AOO  (Area  of  Occupancy),  EOO  (Extent  of  Occurrence),  and  number  of 
âlocationsâ. AOO is defined as âthe area within EOO, which is occupied by the 
species, excluding cases of vagrancyâ. A grid size of 4.2 km
2
 was used in the 
calculation  of  AOO  (Annabelle  Cuttleod,  pers.  comm.;  following:  Gilbert  &amp; 
- 46 - 
Zalat 2008; Basuony et al. 2010). This was calculated by counting the number 
of grid cells occupied by the species and multiplying by the area of each grid 
cell.  EOO  is  defined  as  âthe  area  contained  within  the  shortest  continuous 
imaginary boundary which can be drawn to encompass all the known, inferred 
or  projected  sites  of  present  occurrence  of  a  taxon,  excluding  cases  of 
vagrancyâ  (IUCN  Standards  and  Petitions  Subcommittee  2010).  EOO  is 
measured by calculating the area of the minimum convex polygon containing 
the  records,  i.e.  the  smallest  polygon  containing  all  the  records  that  has  no 
internal  angle  exceeding  180Â°:  this  was  calculated  using  GME  software 
(Geospatial  Modelling  Environment  v0.6  â  see: 
http://www.spatialecology.com/gme/). Any decline in AOO, EOO or number of 
locations  (before  and  after  1950)  were  noted.  The  National  Red  Data  List 
presented in this study should not be considered as the definitive view of the 
current  status  of  Egyptian  reptiles,  but  just  gives  a  rough  indication  of  their 
threat status. A detailed and accurate assessment is needed; a clear example 
is  the  status  of  the  Egyptian  tortoise,  Testudo  kleinmanni.  It  is  classified 
globally as Critically Endangered with very limited current distribution in Egypt, 
but in this study, it is classified as Vulnerable based on information on its very 
limited  distribution  (see  below).  The  global  IUCN  assessment  of  Egyptian 
species was obtained from the IUCN Red List website (IUCN Version 2012.1 - 
see: http://www.iucnredlist.org/). 
 
Area prioritization for conservation 
Recently,  several  algorithms  have  been  available  to  prioritize  areas  for 
conservation  and conservation planning; these include Zonation (Moilanen  et 
al. 2005; Moilanen 2007;  Moilanen et  al. 2012), Marxan (Game  &amp;  Grantham 
2008;  Watts  et  al.  2009),  ConsNet  (Ciarleglio  et  al.  2008;  Ciarleglio  et  al. 
2009),  MultCSync  (Moffett  et  al.  2005),  WorldMap  (Williams  2001),  and 
ResNet (Sarkar et al. 2002). Using the predictions from the species distribution 
models, Zonation v3.1 (Moilanen et al. 2012) was used in this study to create 
a nested  spatial  conservation  prioritization  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  and 
performance of current Protected Area network in Egypt and to prioritize other 
sites for conservation (i.e. potential areas to expand the current PA network).  
- 47 - 
Zonation  is  a  framework  for  conservation  prioritization  and  spatial 
conservation  planning  (Moilanen  et  al.  2012).  It  is  based  on  hierarchically 
prioritizing the conservation value of the landscape based on the conservation 
value  of  sites  (cells)  (Moilanen  2007;  Moilanen  et  al.  2012).  The  software 
starts with the full extent of the landscape, and then generates rankings of the 
cells  by  iteratively  removing  the  least  valuable  cells  from  the  edges  of  the 
landscape  according  to  set  rules  (e.g.  minimizing  marginal  loss  of  the 
conservation  value and maintaining high  habitat connectivity). The last  to be 
removed  are the  most important  areas (Moilanen et al. 2005;  Moilanen et al. 
2012).  The  order  of  the  cell  removal  is  recorded  and  can  be  used  later  to 
select  any  given  top  or bottom  percentage  of  the  landscape (e.g.  highest  or 
lowest 10%) (Moilanen 2007). In Zonation, there are four different cell-removal 
rule  sets  that  specify  how  conservation  value is  aggregated  across  features 
and  space,  determining  which  cell  leads  to  smallest  marginal  loss  of 
biodiversity value: Basic core-area Zonation, Additive benefit function, Target-
based planning, and Generalized benefit function (Moilanen et al. 2012). Two 
of  these  were  used  in  this  study  (Basic  core-area  Zonation  and  Additive 
benefit function).  
Basic  core-area  Zonation  was  used  to  identify  important  (or  poor) 
locations  where  a single  or  a few species have important  occurrences,  while 
Additive  benefit function was used to give  more  weight to  locations with high 
species  richness  (Moilanen  et  al.  2012).  The  resulting  maps  of  conservation 
importance do not agree completely, which means that there can be species-
poor  areas  with  some  rare  species.  The  manual  suggests  running  Zonation 
with  both  removal  options  and  comparing  the  results,  since  this  may  reveal 
some  interesting  information  (Moilanen  et  al.  2012).  In the  calculations  each 
species  is  given  a  weight,  allowing  some  species  to  be  more  important  to 
conserve than others. Unequal weights were assigned to all the reptile species 
using  the  Global  IUCN  assessment,  species  world  distribution,  distribution 
patterns  within  Egypt,  and  national  IUCN  species  classification.  For  each 
element, a score was given (Table 8) to indicate relative importance, and then 
the sum of the scores  gave the relative conservation  weight  of  each species 
(Table 9).

It is undesirable to have a highly fragmented network of reserves, and 
therefore there is a balance to be struck between protecting all the best areas, 
and maintaining large reserves with good connectivity. This is accomplished in 
Zonation  by  the  âaggregation  ruleâ.  I  used  Distribution  Smoothing  as  the 
aggregation rule,  which  estimates the way  each species  uses the  landscape 
and the spatial scale of dispersal, represented by an Î±-value for each species. 
The Î±-value indicates how species use the surrounding landscape and can be 
calculated  based  on  the  dispersal  capability  or  the  home  range sizes  of  the 
species (Moilanen et al. 2012). I calculated it as the following: 
  = 
2
[                  ]
 
 
Dispersal  distance  needs  to  be  in  the  same  units  as  the  predicted 
distribution  maps  (degrees  in  this  study);  so  the  Î±-value  was  adjusted  by 
converting the measurement units from km to degrees using the resolution of 
the maps (2.5 arc-minutes, 0.0416Â°, about 4.6388 km). 
  =  
2 â [4.6388]
[                   (     )] â [0.0416]
 
 
The  dispersal  ability  of  almost  all  terrestrial  reptile  species  is  very 
limited  (Cadby  et  al.  2010;  Edgar  et  al.  2010),  which  makes  them  more 
vulnerable to rapid  environmental  changes  (Araujo &amp;  Pearson  2005). In this 
study,  the  dispersal  distance  of  all  reptiles  was  set  to  be  equal  to  1  km, 
entailing one Î±-value for all species (=223). 
Zonation was run using the maps of occurrence probabilities for all the 
species using both Basic core-area Zonation and Additive benefit function cell 
removal rules. The number of cells removed at each iteration was set to 10 (= 
- 49 - 
âwarp factorâ). Both the  current  and  mean probability  distributions  of  different 
future GCMs were used. Zonation results were produced in the form of ASCII 
raster files,  with  values ranging from 0 to 1. Areas  with Zonation rank  values 
&gt;0.7 were considered to be of high conservation importance. These important 
areas were then overlaid with the current Protected Area system in Egypt (Fig. 
5) to show if the network in Egypt is adequate to conserve the species in the 
face  of  climate  change,  and  if  there  are  areas  outside  the  current  PA 
boundaries that require special protection measures.

Results 
 
Model performance 
The performance of current distribution models, in terms of mean AUC values, 
was  good.  The  mean  AUC  value  of  10  repeat  model  runs  for  each  species 
ranged from 0.78 to 0.99 with an overall mean of 0.93 Â± 0.05. The lowest and 
highest  mean  AUC  values  were for  Ptyodactylus  siphonorhina  (0.78 Â±  0.09) 
and Mesalina pasteuri (0.99 Â± 0.01), respectively (Fig. 11). Only one species 
(Ptyodactylus siphonorhina) had a mean AUC of less than 0.8; there were five 
species between 0.8 and 0.85, 14 species between 0.85 and 0.9, 19 species 
between  0.9  and  0.95  and  36  species  with  mean  AUC  values  greater  than 
0.95  (Fig.  12).  AUC  variability  among  replicate  runs  was  low,  with  standard 
deviations of less than 0.1 in 67 species, between 0.1 and 0.2 in six species, 
and  between  0.2  and  0.3  in  two  species  (Naja  nubiae  and  Hemidactylus 
robustus)  (Table  9).  Mean  AUC  values  for  highly  weighted  species  (weight 
value â¥ 12) range from 0.887 and 0.993, with a mean of 0.97 Â± 0.03. As almost 
all  species  have  a  mean  AUC  value  &gt;  0.8,  all  models  were  accepted  and 
processed for further analyses (see Table 9 for a list of mean AUC value, s.d., 
and the weighting value of each species). 
A  highly  significant  strong  negative  correlation  was  found  between 
mean AUC values and both of the predicted area occupied by the species (in 
terms  of  the  number  of  currently  predicted  suitable  pixels;  n=75,  r s =  -  0.85, 
p&lt;0.005 â Fig. 13) and species current extent of occurrence (EOO - calculated 
as the  minimum convex polygon containing species distribution points; n=75, 
r s =  -  0.77,  p&lt;0.005  â  Fig.  14);  and  a  significant  weak  negative  correlation 
between mean AUC values and the number of species unique recorded points 
used to run the models (n=75, r s = - 0.433, p&lt;0.005 â Fig. 15).  
 
Most influential environmental variables 
Variables  with  highest  mean  permutation  importance  across  all  modelled 
species,  and  hence  potentially  the  highest  contribution  to final models,  were 
altitude,  Bio4  (temperature  seasonality)  and  Bio13  (precipitation  of  wettest 
- 51 - 
month).  Those  with  the  lowest  mean  permutation  importance,  and  thus  not 
influencing the final models very much, were the difference between maximum 
and minimum NDVI, Bio15 (precipitation seasonality), habitat and Bio9 (mean 
temperature  of  driest  quarter)  (Fig.  16).  The  most  influential  environmental 
variable across species was altitude (highest for 34 species), followed by Bio4 
(temperature  seasonality  â  10  species)  and  Bio13  (precipitation  of  wettest 
month  â  9  species)  (Fig.  17).  Two  environmental  variables  were  never  the 
most influential variable for any species: the difference between maximum and 
minimum NDVI and Bio9 (mean temperature of driest quarter). 
 
Species richness 
Current species richness 
Using  probability  distributions,  the  areas  with  the  highest  current  species 
richness are located at the greater Cairo area, the Suez Canal area extending 
from Suez to Port-Said, around Damietta and Alexandria and scattered small 
patches on Suez and Aqaba gulfs in Sinai and the Eastern Desert; other such 
areas  are  Wadi  El-Natrun,  Fayoum  and  scattered  locations  on  the 
Mediterranean coast (Fig. 18). Using thresholded distributions, the areas with 
the  highest  species  richness  are  the  Suez  Canal  area,  the  greater  Cairo 
southwards towards Fayoum and Beni Suef and eastwards towards Suez and 
Ismailia, the northern coast of the Nile Delta from Damietta to Rashid, Wadi El-
Natrun, around Alexandria, coastal areas of the Suez and Aqaba Gulfs in Sinai 
and the Eastern Desert, and the north coast and coastal areas in North Sinai 
(Fig. 20). 
 
Future species richness changes 
Using  probability  distributions,  under  the  A2a  scenario  it  is  predicted  that 
species richness  will increase  by  2020 in coastal  areas between Safaga  and 
El-Quseir, Bir Abraq area, patchy areas on the north coast from Alexandria to 
west of Mersa Matruh, both sides of the Suez Canal near El-Salam lake, east 
of Fayoum in the Nile valley, near Ras Mohamed in South Sinai and scattered 
areas  from  east  and  central  Sinai  northwards  towards  the  Mediterranean 
- 52 - 
coast. Species richness is predicted to decline around the Siwa oasis, inland 
wadis  between  El-Quseir  and  Mersa Alam,  and  small  patches  south  of  Abu 
Zneima in the Suez gulf (Figs. 18, 19). By 2050, species richness is predicted 
to increase on the northern coast from west Alexandria to Sidi Barrani across 
the  northern  edge  of  the  Qattara  Depression,  in  the  Nile  Valley  (around  El-
Minia  and  Fayoum,  and  from  Sohag  to  Edfu),  Red  Sea  coastal  areas  from 
Mersa  Alam  to  north  of  Hurghada, Western  Desert  oases  (Kharga,  Dakhla, 
and Farafra),  South Sinai  (around Ras  Mohamed),  and  an  area from central 
Sinai northwards to the Gebel El-Hallal area. It is predicted to decline in small 
areas around Gebel Elba, southwest of El-Quseir, Siwa oasis, Wadi El-Natrun, 
the greater Cairo, north of Suez and west of Ismailia (Figs. 18, 19). By 2080, 
species  richness  is  predicted  to  increase  more  extensively  along  the  north 
Mediterranean  coast  as  far  south  as  the  northern  part  of  the  Qattara 
Depression, along the Red Sea coast from Mersa Alam to north of Hurghada, 
in the Nile Valley from Fayoum southwards, Western Desert oases, the Gebel 
El-Gallala  area,  on  both  sides  of  the  northern  parts  of  the  Suez  Canal,  the 
coasts of South Sinai and a major part of central Sinai northwards to the Gebel 
El-Hallal area. It is predicted to decline in small areas of Gebel Elba, Wadi El-
Natrun,  the  greater  Cairo  and  scattered  sites  along  the  Suez  Canal  near 
Ismailia (Figs. 18, 19). 
Under  the  B2a  scenario,  the  predicted  patterns  of  change  in  species 
richness do not differ much from those of the A2a scenario (see Figs. 18, 19). 
By 2020, species richness is predicted to increase  in Red Sea coastal areas 
near Berenice and El-Quseir and in small areas near El-Burullus Lake, with a 
greater area of increased species richness at the Mediterranean coast and in 
central to east Sinai. No increase is predicted at Bir Abraq and the Suez Canal 
area, and a greater decline in inland wadis near El-Quseir and at small coastal 
areas  of  the  Suez  and  Aqaba  gulfs  near Zaafarana  and  north  of  Dahab.  By 
2050, there is predicted to be less increase in species richness, compared to 
the A2a scenario, along the Red Sea coast from south of El-Quseir to north of 
Hurghada, in South Sinai, and in the Western Desert oases; greater increase 
in central to east Sinai and in inland wadis west of El-Quseir; and no decline at 
all in Siwa  and the Suez Canal area. By  2080, the  overall pattern  of species 
- 53 - 
richness increase is the same as for the A2a scenario, but the magnitudes and 
areas of increased species richness are lower. 
Using thresholded distributions there are two assumptions to consider, 
unlimited  dispersal  or  the  complete  absence  of  dispersal.  For  unlimited 
dispersal  under  the  A2a  scenario,  it  is  predicted  that  species  richness  will 
increase  by  2020  in  the  Bir  Abraq  area,  inland  areas  of  the  north  coast 
southwards  to  northern  parts  of  the  Qattara  Depression,  central  Sinai 
northwards to the Gebel El-Hallal area, west of Cairo, coastal areas between 
Safaga to south of El-Quseir, and on the western side of the lower Nile Valley 
(the Tushka area).  Declines are predicted in inland wadis from near Berenice 
northwards  to Gebel  El-Gallala,  the  area between  Suez,  Ismailia  and  Cairo, 
coastal  areas  on the Suez  and Aqaba gulfs in Sinai  and the Eastern Desert, 
the Gebel Elba area, Siwa oasis, and northwest of Wadi El-Natrun (Figs. 20, 
21).  By  2050,  species  richness  is  predicted  to  increase  in  the  Qattara 
Depression and inland areas of the north coast, the Abraq area, the Gebel El-
Gallala area, central Sinai northwards to the Gebel El-Hallal area, the northern 
part  of El-Qaa plain  on the eastern side of the  Suez Gulf in  Sinai,  the lower 
Nile  Valley  westwards  to  the  Tushka  area,  and  Western  Desert  oases. 
Declines  are  predicted  in  the  Suez  Canal  area,  greater  Cairo  eastwards 
towards Suez and Ismailia, Wadi El-Natrun northwards, coastal areas of both 
the  Suez  and  Aqaba  gulfs,  inland  wadis  near  the  Red  Sea  coast  between 
Berenice  and  north  of  Hurghada,  the  Gebel  Elba  area  and  scattered  areas 
near  the  North  Sinai  coast  (Figs.  20,  21).  By  2080,  species  richness  is 
predicted  to  increase  over  extensive  areas  covering  a  large  percentage  of 
Egypt,  including  more  than  half  of  the  Western  Desert  (the  Qattara 
Depression, Western Desert oases and Tushka), Gebel El-Gallala, Bir Abraq, 
coastal  areas  north  of  El-Quseir  and  an  area  extending  from  central  Sinai 
northwards  to Gebel  El-Hallal.  Declines  are predicted  in  the  Wadi  El-Natrun 
area,  greater  Cairo  eastwards  towards  Suez  and  Ismailia,  both  sides  of  the 
Suez  Canal,  the  Suez  and  Aqaba  Gulfs,  Gebel  Elba,  North  Sinai  north  of 
Gebel El-Hallal and inland wadis from Mersa Alam to Hurghada (Figs. 20, 21). 
  For  unlimited  dispersal  under  the B2a scenario,  the  overall  pattern  of 
predicted  changes  in  species  richness  does  not  differ  much  from  the  A2a 
scenario (Figs. 20, 21). By 2020, there is predicted to be less increase in the 
- 54 - 
Abraq  area  and  greater  declines  in  Wadi  El-Natrun  and  the  South  Sinai 
coasts.  By  2050,  there  will  be  less  decline  in  Wadi  El-Natrun  and  northern 
parts  of the Suez Canal,  and greater declines in the inland wadis  of the Red 
Sea  (west  of  Mersa  Alam  northwards)  and  on  South Sinai coasts.  By  2080, 
although the overall pattern of species richness increase does not differ from 
that  of  the  A2a  scenario,  the  magnitude  of  the  increase  is  greater  in  central 
and southern parts of the Western Desert, Gebel El-Gallala, the northern part 
of the Nile Delta and coastal areas of the Red Sea; and less in coastal areas 
of North Sinai. 
  Under the no-dispersal assumption and the A2a scenario, it is predicted 
that  species  richness  will  decline  by  2020  in  coastal  areas  of  the  Suez  and 
Aqaba gulfs, the Suez  Canal area, Wadi El-Natrun, the  area  between Cairo, 
Suez  and  Ismailia,  Siwa  oasis  and  the  Qattara  Depression,  Gebel  Elba, 
around  Berenice,  and  inland  wadis  between  Mersa  Alam  and  north  of 
Hurghada  (Figs.  22,  23).  By  2050,  species  richness  is  predicted  to  decline 
further  in  the  area  between  Cairo,  Ismailia  and  Suez,  coastal  areas  of  the 
Suez and Aqaba gulfs, the Nile Valley between Fayoum and Assiut, Red Sea 
inland  wadis  between  Mersa  Alam  and  north  of  Hurghada,  scattered  areas 
around Wadi El-Natrun,  northern  and central Sinai,  and the Gebel Elba  area 
(Figs. 22, 23). By 2080 the greatest decline in species richness is predicted to 
be from Suez southwards on both sides of the northern part of the Suez Gulf, 
Wadi El-Natrun northwards,  and the  area  between Cairo, Ismailia  and Suez; 
smaller  declines  are predicted  in coastal  areas  around the Suez  and  Aqaba 
gulfs, the Suez Canal, Eastern Desert inland wadis, the Qattara Depression, 
Gebel  Elba,  Siwa  oasis  and  Gebel  El-Hallal  northwards  to  the  North  Sinai 
coast (Fig. 22, 23). 
With  no-dispersal  and  under  the  B2a  scenario,  the  overall  pattern  of 
declines  in  future  species  richness  does  not  differ  much  from  the  A2a 
scenario,  but  greater  declines  are  predicted  in  Wadi  El-Natrun,  the  area 
between Cairo, Suez and Ismailia, and on coastal areas on both sides of the 
Suez Gulf (Figs. 22, 23).

Species Gains and Losses 
Under  both  dispersal  assumptions  and  under  the  A2a  scenario,  the  highest 
predicted  species  loss  by  2020  is  predicted  to  be  in  coastal  areas  on  both 
sides of the Suez Gulf, coastal areas in the lower parts of the Aqaba Gulf, the 
area between the greater Cairo, Ismailia and Suez, Siwa oasis, the base of the 
Qattara Depression, inland wadis between Hurghada and Mersa Alam, coastal 
areas  between  north  of  Berenice  and  Abu  Ramad,  and  Wadi  El-Natrun 
northwards (Fig.  24). By  2050, the pattern of species loss  is predicted to be 
the  same  as  in  2020,  with  greater  loss  around  the  lower  part  of  Suez  Gulf, 
Siwa oasis, inland wadis between Hurghada and El-Quseir, northwestern parts 
of  Sinai,  around  Farafra  oasis,  Wadi  El-Natrun  and  in  the  Nile  Valley  from 
Fayoum to Minia; losses are predicted to decrease near Berenice (Fig. 24). By 
2080,  there  is  predicted  to  be greater  species  loss  in the  area  between  the 
greater  Cairo,  Ismailia  and  Suez,  south  of  Suez  on  both  sides  of  the  Suez 
Gulf,  and Wadi  El-Natrun  northwards;  somewhat  less  in  the  area  extending 
from  central  to  north  Sinai,  northern  and  eastern  parts  of  the  Qattara 
Depression,  the  Berenice  area  and  scattered  locations  on  the  north  coast. 
Inland wadis between Hurghada and El-Quseir show smaller losses compared 
to 2050 (Fig. 24).  
  Under  the  B2a  scenario,  the  overall  pattern  of  species  loss  is  much 
greater than predicted under the A2a scenario (Fig. 24). By 2020, there will be 
large losses  on both sides  of the Suez Gulf, Wadi El-Natrun northwards, the 
area  between  the  greater  Cairo,  Ismailia,  and  Suez,  inland  wadis  between 
Hurghada and El-Quseir, and coastal areas of the southern part of the Aqaba 
Gulf; these are somewhat less in the Berenice area, Siwa oasis, northern and 
eastern  parts  of  the  Qattara Depression  and  the  Gebel Elba  area.  By  2050, 
the  same  pattern  is  predicted,  with  greater  losses  in  Wadi  El-Natrun 
northwards,  the  area  between  the  greater  Cairo,  Ismailia  and  Suez,  coastal 
areas on both sides of the Suez Gulf, Siwa oasis and the Qattara Depression; 
these  are  a  bit  lower  in  coastal  areas  of  the  Mediterranean  from  Sallum  to 
Sinai,  inland  wadis  near  Gebel  El-Hallal  westwards,  around the Farafra  and 
Bahariya oases, coastal areas of the northern part of the Aqaba Gulf, around 
Fayoum and the Gebel Elba area. By 2080, the overall pattern of species loss 
does change from that of 2050, with smaller numbers of species being lost on 
- 56 - 
the Mediterranean coast, around Bahariya oasis and Fayoum, northern Sinai, 
the Qattara Depression and northern coastal areas of the Aqaba gulf. 
In  terms  of  species  loss  relative  to  current  (thresholded)  species 
richness, under the A2a scenario the highest relative loss by 2020 is predicted 
to be in the Western Desert oases (Bahariya, Dakhla, and Kharga oases, and 
Siwa  oasis  south-eastwards),  El-Gilf  El-Kebir,  both  sides  of  the  Nile  Valley 
between  Fayoum  and  Aswan,  and  inland  wadis  between  Mersa  Alam  and 
Gebel El-Gallala (Fig. 25). This pattern is predicted not to change by 2050, but 
with  relative greater declines  in the Western Desert  oases (except  Bahariya) 
and relatively smaller declines in El-Gilf El-Kebir and inland and coastal areas 
of  the  northern  half  of  the  Eastern  Desert,  followed  by  Suez  Gulf  coasts  in 
Sinai  and  the  North  Coast  (Fig.  25).  By  2080,  Western  Desert  oases  are 
predicted to undergo greater relative losses (except Bahariya where the areas 
of  high  relative  loss  shrink), followed  by  the  Mediterranean  coast  (especially 
south-east of Sallum), the northern part of the Suez Gulf in Sinai, the area east 
of  greater  Cairo  and  northern  and  central  parts  of  the  Nile  Delta.  Areas  of 
earlier high relative species loss in the northern part of the Eastern Desert are 
predicted to shrink in area by 2080 (Fig. 25).  
Under  B2a  scenario,  the  overall  pattern  of  relative  species  loss  is 
similar to  that  of A2a scenario,  with greater relative  losses in inland wadis  of 
the  northern half of the Eastern Desert,  around Western Desert  oases, Wadi 
El-Natrun  and  the  Mediterranean  coast.  By  2050,  there  is  predicted  to  be 
greater relative loss in the area between Gebel Elba and Wadi El-Allaqi (Fig. 
25). 
Under  unlimited  dispersal  and  the  A2a  scenario,  the  highest  gains  in 
species  by  2020  are  predicted  to  be  on  the  Mediterranean  coast  west  of 
Alexandria, central and south-eastern parts of the Qattara Depression, eastern 
and central Sinai northwards towards Gebel El-Hallal, Bir Abraq,  and coastal 
areas north and south of El-Quseir (Fig. 26). By 2050, the predictions have the 
same  overall  pattern  of  species  gain,  with  an  expansion  in  area  on  the 
Mediterranean coast,  the Qattara Depression  and central to north  Sinai;  and 
with  smaller  gains  at  Bir  Abraq  (Fig.  26).  By  2080,  there  is  predicted  to  be 
continuing  increases  in  gains  on  the  Mediterranean  coast,  the  Qattara 
- 57 - 
Depression,  north  of  Siwa,  scattered  areas  on  both  sides  of  the  Nile  Valley 
from  Fayoum  southwards,  Gebel El-Maghrabi  east  of  Edfu,  Gebel  El-Gallala 
and coastal  areas between Hurghada  and Mersa Alam; somewhat smaller in 
areas  on  both sides  of the  northern part  of the Suez Canal and the Western 
Desert oases (Fig. 26).  
Under the B2a scenario and unlimited dispersal, there is predicted to be 
an  overall  increase  in  gains  across  Egypt  relative  to  the  A2a  scenario.  By 
2020,  the  highest  increase  in  species  gains  is  predicted  to  be  on  the 
Mediterranean  coast,  the  Qattara  Depression,  areas  around  the  Nile  Valley 
from  north  of  Fayoum  to  Edfu,  the  Western  Desert  oases,  Bir  Abraq,  the 
coastal  area from  north  of Hurghada to south  of  El-Quseir, Gebel  El-Gallala, 
the  area  extending  from  eastern  and  central  Sinai  northwards  to  Gebel  El-
Hallal,  south  of  Rafah,  and  areas  on  both  sides  of  the  northern  part  of  the 
Suez Canal (Fig. 26).  By  2050,  a large proportion  of the  northern half  of the 
Western  Desert  is  predicted  to  gain  many  more  species  (including  the 
Mediterranean  coast  and  Siwa  oasis,  with  the  highest  gains  in  the  Qattara 
Depression). Areas with high predicted gains also include the Western Desert 
oases,  the  Tushka  area  northwards,  areas  on  both  sides  of  the  Nile  Valley 
from  north  of  Fayoum  southwards,  Bir  Abraq,  the  northern  part  of  the  Nile 
Delta, Gebel El-Gallala, coastal areas from north of Hurghada to Mersa Alam, 
an area extending from central to northwestern Sinai and south of Rafah (Fig. 
26). By 2080, the pattern of areas of highest predicted gains is similar to that 
of  2050,  with  contractions  in  some  areas  including  around  Western  Desert 
oases,  Tushka,  around  the  Nile  Valley,  the  northern  Nile  Delta,  Gebel  El-
Gallala,  south  of  Rafah  and  the  Red  Sea  coast  from  north  of  Hurghada  to 
Mersa Alam (Fig. 26). 
Predicted  gains  in  species  relative  to  current  (thresholded)  species 
richness  under  the  A2a  scenario  by  2020  are  highest  on  both  sides  of  the 
lower  Nile  Valley  from  Qena  southwards,  Tushka  area,  west  of  Fayoum 
towards  the  west  and  south  of  the  Bahariya  oasis,  and  north  and  south  of 
Siwa; these are somewhat smaller west and north-west of Farafra, the Qattara 
Depression  northwards  towards  inland  areas  of  the  Mediterranean  coast, 
scattered  areas  in  central  Sinai,  Kharga  southwards  and  westwards,  and  a 
small area south of Damietta (Fig. 27). By 2050, the overall predicted pattern 
- 58 - 
is similar,  with increases in the centre  of the Qattara Depression  northwards 
and  an  area  extending  from  west  of  Fayoum  towards  west  and  south  of 
Bahariya (Fig. 27). By 2080, there are predicted to be even greater increases 
in  both  area  and  magnitudes  in the  Qattara Depression  northwards  towards 
inland  areas  of  the  Mediterranean  coast,  north  and  south  of  Siwa,  an  area 
extending  from  west  of  Fayoum  towards  west  and  south  of  Bahariya  oasis, 
around  Dakhla  and  Kharga,  and  on  both  sides  of  the  lower  Nile  Valley 
especially mountainous areas of the Eastern Desert (Fig. 27).  
Under the B2a scenario, the overall pattern of relative gain shows much 
higher  magnitudes  compared  to  the  A2a  scenario.  By  2020,  the  predicted 
pattern of relative gains resembles that of 2080 for the A2a scenario, and by 
2050 and 2080, there is predicted to be large areas with relatively high gains, 
mainly in the Qattara Depression  northwards,  around Western Desert  oases, 
west  and  north  of  Fayoum  and  around  the  lower  part  of  the  Nile  Valley 
especially in mountainous areas of the Eastern Desert (Fig. 27). 
 
Species Turnover 
Under unlimited dispersal and the A2a scenario, by 2020 the highest predicted 
turnover  in  species  composition  is  predicted  to  be  in  the  Western  Desert 
(south-east  of  Bahariya  westwards  to  the  Libyan  borders,  around  Dakhla, 
around Kharga  down  to the Sudanese borders,  and north  of El-Gilf El-Kebir) 
and  around  the  Nile  Valley  from  Assiut  southwards;  values  are  somewhat 
lower  west  and  south  of  Fayoum,  north  and  north-west  of  the  Qattara 
Depression, and in the Bir Abraq area, as well as scattered inland wadis in the 
Eastern  Desert  (Fig.  28).  By  2050,  a  similar  pattern  is  predicted,  with  slight 
declines  in  turnover  west  of  Farafra  near  the  Libyan  borders  (Fig.  28).  By 
2080, the pattern again does not change much, with greater expansion in the 
areas  of  high  turnover  around  the  southern  part  of  the  Nile  Valley  and  the 
Western Desert (south and west of Kharga and Dakhla); and slight increases 
in turnover in the greater Cairo area, Wadi El-Natrun westwards to Libya, the 
central  Nile  Delta  and  in  central  to  northern  Sinai  (Fig.  28).  Under  the  B2a 
scenario, the predicted pattern of species turnover resembles that of the A2a 
scenario,  but  with  an  overall  increase  in  the  areas  of  high  turnover,  and 
- 59 - 
especially  by  2050  continuing  to  2080,  almost  all  the  southern  half  of  the 
Western Desert is predicted to  undergo  high turnover in species composition 
(Fig. 28). 
When  no-dispersal  is  allowed,  under  the  A2a  scenario  the  highest 
turnover  in  species  composition  by  2020  is  predicted  to  be  in  the  Bahariya 
oasis south-westwards towards the Libya border, around Kharga and Dakhla, 
El-Gilf El-Kebir, scattered areas on both sides of the lower Nile Valley from El-
Minia southwards, south  of Siwa  and scattered  mountainous locations in the 
middle of the Eastern Desert (Fig. 29). The predicted pattern does not change 
much by 2050  and 2080, with high  declines predicted for  Farafra westwards 
by 2050, and increases in El-Gilf El-Kebir by 2050 and 2080 (Fig. 29). Under 
the  B2a scenario,  the  overall  pattern  of  predicted  species  turnover  does  not 
differ  much  from  the  A2a  scenario,  but  with  greater  increases  in  El-Gilf  El-
Kebir,  south  of  Siwa,  and  areas  around  Bahariya,  Kharga,  and  Farafra.  By 
2050  and  2080,  there  is  predicted  to  be  a  moderate  increase  in  species 
turnover in the central Nile Delta westwards to the Mediterranean coast and in 
scattered mountainous areas of the Eastern Desert (Fig. 29). 
 
Range Changes  
With  unlimited  dispersal,  no  species  is  predicted  to  become  extinct  in  the 
future  under  all  or  the  average  of  the  global circulation  models.  There  are  a 
couple  of  species  predicted  to  become  extinct  by  losing  their  entire  area  of 
suitable habitat in at least  one  of the future projections: Tarentola  mindiae is 
predicted  to  become  extinct  by  2080  under  both  emission  scenarios  of  the 
CSIRO  and  NIES99  models,  and  under  the  A2a  scenario  of  the  HadCM3 
model;  and  Hemidactylus  robustus  is  predicted  to  become  extinct  by  2080 
under  both  emission  scenarios  of  the  CSIRO  model,  and  under  the  A2a 
scenario of the HadCM3 model (Table 10 - Fig. 30). 
Using  the  average  gain  or  loss  of  suitable  habitat  across  the  four 
different global circulation models (Table 10), only one species is predicted to 
be classified as Critically Endangered (i.e. predicted to lose more than 80% of 
suitable habitat) by 2020: this species is Hemidactylus robustus under the A2a 
scenario.  By  2050,  two  species  are  predicted  to  be  classified  as  Critically 
- 60 - 
Endangered  under  both  emission  scenarios  (Hemidactylus  robustus  and 
Tarentola  mindiae).  The  number  of  such  species  is  predicted  to  increase by 
2080  to  eight  species:  four  under  both  emission  scenarios  (Eumeces 
schneiderii,  Malpolon  moilensis,  Tarentola  mindiae  and  Trapelus  mutabilis), 
three  under  only  the  A2a  scenario  (Cerastes  vipera,  Eryx  jaculus  and 
Ptyodactylus  guttatus)  and  one  under  only  the  B2a  scenario  (Hemidactylus 
robustus) (Tables 10, 12 - Fig. 30). 
Five  species  are  predicted  to  be  classified  as  Endangered  (i.e. 
predicted  to  lose  50-80%  of  suitable  habitat)  by  2020:  one  under  both 
emission  scenarios  (Tarentola  mindiae),  one  under  only  the  A2a  scenario 
(Pristurus  flavipunctatus)  and  three  under  only  the  B2a  scenario 
(Hemidactylus  robustus,  Malpolon  moilensis  and  Ptyodactylus  guttatus).  By 
2050,  six  species  are  now  predicted  to  be  classified  as  Endangered  under 
both  emission  scenarios  (Eryx  jaculus,  Eumeces  schneiderii,  Malpolon 
moilensis,  Pristurus  flavipunctatus,  Ptyodactylus  guttatus  and  Trapelus 
mutabilis). By 2080, 16 species are predicted to be so classified: seven under 
both  emission  scenarios  (Acanthodactylus  longipes,  Agama  spinosa, 
Leptotyphlops  macrorhynchus,  Naja  haje,  Pristurus  flavipunctatus, 
Ptyodactylus siphonorhina and Tarentola mauritanica), six under only the A2a 
scenario  (Hemidactylus  robustus,  Laudakia  stellio,  Psammophis  schokari, 
Sphenops  sepsoides,  Uromastyx  aegyptia  and  Walterinnesia  aegyptia)  and 
three  under  only  the  B2a  scenario  (Cerastes  vipera,  Eryx  jaculus  and 
Ptyodactylus guttatus) (Tables 10, 12 - Fig. 30). 
Eight species are predicted to be classified as Vulnerable (i.e. predicted 
to  lose  30-50%  of  suitable  habitat)  by  2020:  two  under  both  emission 
scenarios  (Eryx  jaculus  and  Trapelus  mutabilis),  three  under  only  the  A2a 
scenario (Malpolon moilensis, Ptyodactylus guttatus and Stenodactylus petrii) 
and  three  under  only  the  B2a  scenario  (Pristurus  flavipunctatus,  Uromastyx 
aegyptia  and Walterinnesia aegyptia). By  2050,  eleven species  are predicted 
to  be  classified  as  Vulnerable:  seven  under  both  emission  scenarios 
(Acanthodactylus  longipes,  Leptotyphlops  macrorhynchus,  Naja  haje, 
Ptyodactylus  siphonorhina,  Tarentola  mauritanica,  Uromastyx  aegyptia  and 
Walterinnesia  aegyptia),  one  under  only  the  A2a  scenario  (Cerastes  vipera) 
and  three  under  only  the  B2a  scenario  (Agama  spinosa,  Telescopus  dhara 
- 61 - 
and  Tropiocolotes  tripolitanus).  By  2080,  ten  species  are  so  classified:  six 
under  both  emission  scenarios  (Acanthodactylus  aegyptius,  Malpolon 
monspessulanus,  Scincus  scincus,  Telescopus  dhara,  Tropiocolotes 
tripolitanus  and  Uromastyx  ocellata),  one  under  only  the  A2a  scenario 
(Stenodactylus  petrii)  and  three  under  only  the  B2a  scenario  (Psammophis 
schokari,  Uromastyx  aegyptia  and  Walterinnesia  aegyptia)  (Tables  10,  12  - 
Fig. 30). 
Twenty-two  species  are classified  as  Least  Concern (i.e.  predicted  to 
lose  less  than  30%  of  suitable  habitat)  by  2020:  13  under  both  emission 
scenarios,  six  under  only  the  A2a  scenario  and  three  under  only  the  B2a 
scenario.  By  2050,  16  species  are  so classified:  seven  under  both  emission 
scenarios,  seven  under  only  the  A2a  scenario  and  two  under  only  the  B2a 
scenario.  By  2080,  only  six  are  so  classified:  four  under  both  emission 
scenarios and one each under only the A2a or B2a scenarios (Tables 10, 12 - 
Fig. 30). 
For those that are predicted to gain rather than to lose range under the 
unlimited dispersal assumption, three species  are  predicted to  gain less than 
30% of their current range under all combinations of time slices and emission 
scenarios.  Some  species  are  predicted  the  same,  but  not  under  all 
combinations of times and scenarios. By 2020, there are 28 of these species: 
16 under both emission scenarios, four under only the A2a scenario and eight 
under  only  the  B2a  scenario.  By  2050,  there  are  17  of  these  species:  five 
under both emission scenarios, six under only the A2a scenario and six under 
only the B2a scenario. By 2080, there are ten such species: three under both 
emission scenarios, two under only the A2a scenario and five under only the 
B2a scenario (Tables 10, 12 - Fig. 31). 
Twelve species are predicted to gain 30-50% of their currently occupied 
area  by  2020:  four  under  both  emission  scenarios,  six  under  only  the  A2a 
scenario  and  two  under  only  the  B2a  scenario.  By  2050, there  are seven  of 
these  species:  one  under  both  emission  scenarios,  one  under  only  the  A2a 
scenario and five under only the B2a scenario. By 2080, there are eight such 
species: two under both emission scenarios, four under only the A2a scenario 
and two under only the B2a scenario (Tables 10, 12 - Fig. 31). 
- 62 - 
Ten  species  are  predicted  to  gain  50-80%  of  their  currently  occupied 
area by  2020: three under  both emission scenarios, four  under  only the A2a 
scenario  and three  under  only  the  B2a scenario. By  2050, there  are  14 such 
species: nine at both  emission scenarios, three  under  only the A2a scenario 
and two under  only  the  B2a scenario. By 2080, there are  nine such species: 
two under both emission scenarios, two under only the A2a scenario and five 
under only the B2a scenario (Tables 10, 12 - Fig. 31). 
Five species are predicted to gain 80-100% of their currently occupied 
area  by  2020:  two  under  both  emission  scenarios,  two  under  only  the  A2a 
scenario  and  one under  only the B2a scenario. By 2050, there  are  four such 
species: one under both emission scenarios, one under just the A2a scenario 
and  two  under  just  the  B2a scenario.  By  2080,  there  are  five  such  species: 
three under just the A2a scenario and two under just the B2a scenario (Tables 
10, 12 - Fig. 31). 
Five  species  are  predicted  to  gain  more  than  100%  of  their  currently 
occupied  area  under  all combinations  of time slices  and  emission  scenarios. 
Some species are predicted to gain the same under at least one combination. 
By 2020, there are three under just the B2a scenario. By 2050, there are ten 
such species: eight under both emission scenarios and two under just the B2a 
scenario.  By  2080,  there  are  18  such  species:  13  under  both  emission 
scenarios,  four  under  just  the  A2a  scenario  and  one  under  just  the  B2a 
scenario (Tables 10, 12 - Fig. 31). 
The  percentages  of  species  falling  under  each category  are  shown  in 
Fig. 33 a &amp; b. The overall trend in predicted gain/loss (Fig. 34) indicates that 
under  the  assumption  of  unlimited  dispersal  there  will  be  a  continuous 
increasing gain in range for the average species with time, with little difference 
between emission scenarios; by 2080 under the A2a scenario there is slightly 
more  gain  and  more  variability  than  expected.  The  average  range  change 
across  different  taxonomic  groups  seems  to  be  the  highest  for  Varanidae 
(160%  by  2020,  and  up  to  600-800%  increase  by  2080);  while  for  other 
groups, this ranges from 6% to 156% increase (Fig. 35). 
When  assuming  no  dispersal  at  all,  of  course  no  gains  in  area  are 
possible,  merely  losses.  Again  no  species  is  predicted  to  become  extinct 
- 63 - 
under  all  global  circulation  models.  Two  species  are  predicted  to  become 
extinct  in  at  least  one  of  the  projections:  Tarentola  mindiae  is  predicted  to 
become extinct by 2050 under the A2a scenario, and by 2080 at both emission 
scenarios  of  the  CSIRO  model,  and  also  under  the  A2a  scenario  of  the 
HadCM3 model; and Hemidactylus robustus is predicted to become extinct by 
2080 under both scenarios of the CSIRO model, and under the A2a scenario 
of the HadCM3 model (Tables 11, 13 - Fig. 32). 
One  species  is  predicted  to  be classified  as  Critically Endangered  by 
2020 (Hemidactylus robustus - under the A2a scenario). Three species are so 
classified by 2050: two under both emission scenarios (Hemidactylus robustus 
and  Tarentola  mindiae)  and  one  under  just  the  A2a  scenario  (Trapelus 
mutabilis).  There  are  ten  such  species  by  2080:  five  under  both  emission 
scenarios  (Eumeces  schneiderii,  Malpolon  moilensis,  Ptyodactylus  guttatus, 
Tarentola  mindiae  and  Trapelus  mutabilis),  four  under just  the  A2a scenario 
(Acanthodactylus  longipes,  Cerastes  vipera,  Eryx  jaculus  and  Ptyodactylus 
siphonorhina)  and  one  under just  the B2a scenario (Hemidactylus  robustus) 
(Tables 11, 13 - Fig. 32).  
Seven species  are predicted  to  be classified  as Endangered by 2020: 
five  under  both  emission  scenarios  (Malpolon  moilensis,  Pristurus 
flavipunctatus,  Ptyodactylus  guttatus,  Tarentola  mindiae  and  Uromastyx 
aegyptia)  and  two  under  just  the  B2a  scenario  (Hemidactylus  robustus  and 
Trapelus  mutabilis).  By  2050,  there  are 11 species  so  classified:  nine  under 
both  emission  scenarios  (Acanthodactylus  longipes,  Eryx  jaculus,  Eumeces 
schneiderii,  Malpolon  moilensis,  Pristurus  flavipunctatus,  Ptyodactylus 
guttatus,  Ptyodactylus  siphonorhina,  Telescopus  dhara  and  Uromastyx 
aegyptia) and one under each of A2a and B2a scenarios (Cerastes vipera and 
Trapelus  mutabilis,  respectively).  In  2080,  there  are  22  such  species:  nine 
under  both  emission  scenarios  (Agama  spinosa,  Leptotyphlops 
macrorhynchus,  Naja  haje,  Pristurus  flavipunctatus,  Sphenops  sepsoides, 
Tarentola  mauritanica,  Telescopus  dhara,  Tropiocolotes  steudneri  and 
Uromastyx  aegyptia),  seven  under  just  the  A2a  scenario  (Acanthodactylus 
aegyptius,  Hemidactylus  robustus,  Laudakia  stellio,  Psammophis  schokari, 
Scincus  scincus,  Uromastyx  ocellata  and  Walterinnesia  aegyptia)  and  six 
under just the B2a scenario (Acanthodactylus longipes, Cerastes vipera, Eryx 
- 64 - 
jaculus,  Platyceps  saharicus,  Psammophis  sibilans  and  Ptyodactylus 
siphonorhina) (Tables 11, 13 - Fig. 32). 
Thirteen species are classified as Vulnerable by 2020: eight under both 
emission  scenarios  (Acanthodactylus  longipes,  Eryx  jaculus,  Leptotyphlops 
macrorhynchus,  Mesalina  pasteuri,  Platyceps  saharicus,  Psammophis 
sibilans, Ptyodactylus siphonorhina and Telescopus dhara), one under just the 
A2a  scenario  (Trapelus  mutabilis)  and  four  under  just  the  B2a  scenario 
(Agama spinosa, Echis pyramidum, Tropiocolotes steudneri and Walterinnesia 
aegyptia).  By  2050,  there  are  17  such  species:  13  under  both  emission 
scenarios  (Acanthodactylus  aegyptius,  Agama  spinosa,  Leptotyphlops 
macrorhynchus,  Naja  haje,  Platyceps  saharicus,  Psammophis  schokari, 
Psammophis  sibilans,  Spalerosophis  diadema,  Sphenops  sepsoides, 
Tarentola mauritanica, Tropiocolotes steudneri, Tropiocolotes tripolitanus and 
Walterinnesia aegyptia), two under just the A2a scenario (Laudakia stellio and 
Scincus  scincus)  and  two  under  just  the  B2a scenario  (Cerastes  vipera  and 
Mesalina  pasteuri).  By  2080,  20  species  are  so  classified:  six  under  both 
emission  scenarios  (Chalcides  ocellatus,  Echis  pyramidum,  Malpolon 
monspessulanus,  Platyceps  florulentus,  Spalerosophis  diadema  and 
Tropiocolotes  tripolitanus),  eight  under  just  the  A2a  scenario  (Eirenis 
coronella, Mesalina bahaeldini, Naja nubiae, Ophisops occidentalis, Platyceps 
saharicus,  Psammophis  sibilans,  Stenodactylus  petrii  and  Tropiocolotes 
bisharicus)  and  six  under  just  the  B2a  scenario (Acanthodactylus  aegyptius, 
Laudakia stellio, Psammophis schokari, Scincus scincus, Uromastyx ocellata 
and Walterinnesia aegyptia) (Tables 11, 13 - Fig. 32).  
Thirty-five  species  are  predicted  to  be  classified  as  Least  Concern 
under  all possible combinations  of time slices  and emission scenarios. Other 
than  these  species,  some  species  are  so  classified  under  at  least  one 
combination  of  settings.  25  species  are  predicted  to  be  classified  as  Least 
Concern by 2020: 21 under  both emission scenarios  and four under just the 
A2a  scenario.  By  2050,  14  species  are  so  classified:  eleven  under  both 
emission  scenarios,  one  under  just  the  A2a  scenario  and  two  under  just  the 
B2a  scenario.  By  2080,  there  are  seven  such  species:  one  under  both 
emission scenarios and six under just the B2a scenario (Tables 11, 13 - Fig. 
32).  
- 65 - 
The percentages of species predicted to be in each category under the 
no-dispersal assumption are shown in Fig. 33 c &amp; d. The overall trend (Fig. 34) 
indicates that there will be a continuous increase in species loss through time, 
with  few  differences  between  emission  scenarios  except  a  greater-than-
expected  loss  by  2020 under  the B2a  scenario  and  by  2080  under the  A2a 
scenario. The average range decline across different taxonomic groups seems 
to be  low for Varanidae (3-5% loss), followed by the tortoises (10-20%). The 
highest  average  loss  by  2020  is  predicted  for  the  Agamidae  (21-28%), 
followed by the Gekonidae (25%) and then the snakes (19-24%). By 2050, the 
highest average loss is predicted for the Geckonidae (31%), Agamidae (30%), 
snakes (29%) and Scincidae (26%); by 2080, for Agamidae (37-42%), Snakes 
(35-39%), Scincidae (32-39%) then by Gekonidae (36-38%) (Fig. 35). 
 
Reptile species classifications 
According  to the  current  IUCN  Red  List  website  (http://www.iucnredlist.org/), 
19  Egyptian  reptiles  have  been  assessed  globally:  one  is  classified  as 
Critically  Endangered  (Testudo  kleinmanni),  two  as  Vulnerable 
(Acanthodactylus  pardalis  and  Trapelus  savignii)  and  16  as  Least  Concern. 
Fifty-six  species  have  not  been  classified  globally  yet.  Among  the  reptile 
species excluded from this study, two near-endemic species are in the IUCN 
global  Red  List:  Philochortus  zolii  is  Critically  Endangered  [B1  ab(iii)]  and 
Telescopus  hoogstraali  is  Endangered  [B1ab(iii)]  (BÃ¶hme  &amp;  Baha  El  Din 
2006b; Disi et al. 2006). According to Egyptâs  national Red  List  assessment, 
three  species  are classified  as  Endangered  (Leptotyphlops  cairi,  Chamaeleo 
africanus and Uromastyx ocellata), 24 as Vulnerable and 48 as Least Concern 
(for  the  global  and  national  IUCN  classification  of  the  Egyptian  reptiles,  see 
Table 5). 
According  to  their  world  distribution,  6  species  are  classified  as 
Endemic  or Near-Endemic  (Acanthodactylus  aegyptius,  Mesalina  bahaeldini, 
Tarentola  mindiae,  Testudo  kleinmanni,  Trapelus  savignii  and  Tropiocolotes 
bisharicus),  eight  as  Restricted  (Acanthodactylus  pardalis,  Naja  nubiae, 
Ophisops  occidentalis,  Ptyodactylus  siphonorhina,  Sphenops  sepsoides, 
Stenodactylus  mauritanicus,  Uromastyx  ornata  and  Walterinnesia  aegyptia), 
- 66 - 
52  species  as  Narrow  and  9  as  widespread  (Table  5).  Two  endemics 
(Hemidactylus  foudaii  and  Tropiocolotes  bisharicus)  and  five  near-endemics 
(Acanthodactylus  pardalis,  Philochortus  zolii,  Platyceps  sinai,  Telescopus 
hoogstraali and Tropiocolotes nubicus) were not included in this study due to 
their limited number of unique records. 
According to  their  distribution  within Egypt, nine species  are classified 
as Localized (Eirenis coronella, Mesalina bahaeldini, Mesalina pasteuri, Natrix 
tessellata,  Ophisops  occidentalis,  Platyceps  florulentus,  Stenodactylus 
mauritanicus, Uromastyx ornata and Varanus niloticus), 31 as Narrow and 35 
as Widespread (Table 5). 
Species  with  highest  weighting  scores  were  found  to  be  Testudo 
kleinmanni, Trapelus savignii,  Acanthodactylus pardalis, Mesalina bahaeldini, 
Ophisops  occidentalis,  Stenodactylus  mauritanicus,  Uromastyx  ornata, 
Tarentola mindiae and Tropiocolotes bisharicus (Table 5).  
 
Reptile records in Protected Areas 
Using  database  records,  the  highest  number  of  recorded  species  per 
Protected Area  was found at St Katherine, followed by Gebel Elba, Wadi El-
Gemal  and  Lake  Qarun  (Table  14).  No  records  were  available  from  eight 
Protected  Areas  (Saluga  &amp;  Ghazal,  Ashtum  El-Gamil,  Sanur  Cave,  Nile 
Islands, Red Sea northern islands, El-Dababya, El-Sallum Gulf and Mt Kamel 
Meteor).  Using  the  thresholded  predicted  distributions,  the  number  of 
climatically  suitable  species  per  Protected  Area  was  found  to  be  highest  at 
Lake Burullus, Nabq, Gebel Elba, Ashtum El-Gamil, Taba and Wadi El-Gemal 
(Table  14).  There  is  a  non-significant  correlation  between  the  number  of 
recorded  and  climatically  suitable  species  across  Protected  Areas  (n=23, 
r s =0.49,  p=0.12  one-tailed  â  Fig.  36).  The  highest  difference  between  the 
number of predicted and recorded species was for Lake Burullus, Nabq, Siwa, 
Abu  Galum,  Ras  Mohamed,  Taba  and  Al-Ahrash.  There  is  a  significant 
positive  correlation  between  the  area  of  the  Protected  Areas  and  both  the 
number  of  recorded  species  (n=23,  r s =0.64,  p=0.001  â  Fig.  37)  and  the 
number of predicted climatically suitable species (thresholded) (n=23, r s =0.46, 
p=0.03 â Fig. 37). 
- 67 - 
Under the assumption of unlimited dispersal and the A2a scenario, the 
highest predicted loss of species by 2020 is predicted to be at Ras Mohamed, 
followed by Lake Qarun, Wadi El-Assuti, Wadi Degla and the White Desert. By 
2050,  Wadi  Degla  is  predicted  to  lose  the  most  species,  followed  by  St 
Katherine, Wadi Allaqi, Zaranik, Wadi El-Assuti, the White Desert and Wadi El-
Rayan.  By  2080,  again  Wadi  Degla  is  predicted  to  lose  the  most  species, 
followed  by  Ras  Mohamed,  Zaranik,  Wadi  Allaqi,  the  White  Desert,  St 
Katherine, Lake Qarun, El-Omayed and Wadi El-Gemal (Table 14). Under the 
B2a scenario, the highest predicted species loss by 2020 is predicted to be at 
Ras Mohamed, followed by Wadi Degla, the White Desert, Wadi El-Assuti, St 
Katherine  and  Lake  Qarun.  By  2050,  the  highest  is  Wadi  Degla,  Ras 
Mohamed  and  the White  Desert;  and  by  2080, Wadi Degla, Wadi  El-Assuti, 
the White Desert and Zaranik (Table 14). 
Under the A2a scenario, the highest predicted species gain by 2020 is 
for El-Dababya, Siwa  and El-Omayed; by 2050, Siwa,  Lake Qarun and Wadi 
El-Assuti;  by  2080,  Siwa  and Taba  (Table 14).  Under  the  B2a scenario,  the 
highest  predicted species  gain by 2020 is for Siwa  and the White  Desert; by 
2050, Wadi El-Assuti, Siwa and the White Desert; by 2080, El-Omayed, Siwa 
and the White Desert (Table 14). 
Under the assumption of no-dispersal and the A2a scenario, the highest 
number  of  species  lost  by  2020  is  predicted  to  be  at  Wadi  Degla,  Ras 
Mohamed,  Wadi  Allaqi  and  the  White  Desert;  by  2050,  Wadi  Degla,  Wadi 
Allaqi  and  Zaranik;  and  by  2080,  Wadi  Degla,  Ras  Mohamed,  Zaranik  and 
Nabq (Table 14). Under the B2a scenario, the highest predicted species loss 
by 2020 is at Ras Mohamed and Wadi Degla; by 2050, Ras Mohamed, Wadi 
Degla and the White Desert; and by 2080, Wadi Degla, Ras Mohamed, Wadi 
El-Assuti, White Desert and Zaranik (Table 14). 
 
Area prioritization for conservation 
Using the assumption of âadditive benefit functionâ, the areas with the highest 
current  prioritization  value  were  located  on  the  Mediterranean  coast  from 
Rafah  to Sallum,  high-elevation  areas  of  South  Sinai,  the  Suez  Canal  area, 
greater Cairo  north-  and  eastwards  towards  Suez,  Ismailia  and  Sharqia  and 
- 68 - 
southwards  towards  Fayoum  and  El-Minia,  the  area  between  Cairo  and 
Alexandria (including Wadi El-Natrun), coastal areas of both Suez and Aqaba 
Gulfs,  the  Red  Sea  coast,  the  Gebel  Elba  area,  Siwa  oasis,  the  Qattara 
Depression (especially the central  and northern parts), scattered locations in 
the  Nile Valley  from  Qena  to Aswan,  inland  areas  of  North  Sinai  (Gebel  El-
Hallal), the Nile Delta, around Farafra and Kharga oases, inland wadis in the 
Eastern Desert, and moderate-elevation wadis in South and central Sinai (Fig. 
38). 
The overall pattern of prioritization value does not seem to change very 
much  in  climate  projections  into  the  future.  According  to  the  A2a  scenario, 
there will be a restricted decline confined to small area south of Siwa oasis (by 
2020) and small wadi area west of Safaga (at all time slices) (Figs. 38, 39). By 
2050,  prioritization  value  is  predicted  to be increased  in the  Bir Abraq  area, 
Gebel  El-Gallala  southwards,  western  parts  of  central  Sinai,  east  and south-
east of Suez, Siwa oasis, inland western parts of the Mediterranean coast, the 
area  between  west  of  Bahariya  oasis  and  Fayoum,  inland  wadis  between 
Mersa Alam and Safaga, and a small area on the Sudanese border (southwest 
of Wadi El-Allaqi) (Figs. 38, 39). By 2080, there is predicted to be more areas 
characterized  by increased prioritization  value,  including west  of Qarun  Lake 
and west of Bahariya oasis; followed by a large proportion of the northern part 
of  the  Western  Desert,  inland  wadis  in  the  Eastern  Desert  (from  Gebel  El-
Gallala  to  Gebel  Elba),  both  sides  of  the  Nile  Valley  from  Fayoum  to  Edfu, 
around the Kharga, Dakhla and Farafra oases, and eastern and western parts 
of central Sinai (Figs. 38, 39).  
In the B2a scenario, by 2020 and 2050, there will be restricted declines 
in prioritization value confined to south of Siwa oasis, a small area north of El-
Gilf El-Kebir and scattered locations in Eastern-Desert wadis (between Mersa 
Alam  and Safaga) (Figs. 38, 39). By 2050, prioritization  value  is predicted  to 
increase in the Abraq area southwards to Gebel Elba, Gebel El-Gallala, inland 
areas  of  the  Mediterranean  coast,  Siwa  oasis,  west  of  Fayoum  towards 
Bahariya  and  eastern  and  western  parts  of  central  Sinai  (Figs.  38,  39).  By 
2080,  there  will  be  more  such  priority  areas,  including  a  major  part  of  the 
northern half of the Western Desert, the Abraq area southwards to Gebel Elba, 
inland  wadis  from  Gebel  El-Gallala  southwards  to  El-Quseir,  the  Nile  Valley 
- 69 - 
between Fayoum and Edfu, central Sinai, and around the Farafra, Dakhla and 
Kharga oases (Figs. 38, 39).  
The  mean  prioritization  value  in  all  models  was  found to be higher  in 
Protected Area than outside them, with overall a slight increase in prioritization 
value in the future.  The  difference in  prioritization  value  between  inside  and 
outside Protected Areas seems to decline in the future, especially by 2050 and 
2080 under the B2a scenario (Fig. 42). 
Using  the  âcore-area  functionâ  assumption,  areas  with  the  highest 
current prioritization value were located in high-elevation wadis in South Sinai, 
Gebel Elba, Siwa oasis, the northern part of the Qattara Depression, the Suez 
Canal  area,  coastal  areas  of  the  Aqaba  Gulf,  Red  Sea  coastal  areas  from 
south of Safaga to south of Halayeb, the Mediterranean coast from Sallum to 
Rafah  and the Nile Valley from Qena to the Sudanese  border. Slightly lower 
priority  was  given  to  non-coastal  areas  in  North  Sinai  (Gebel  El-Hallal);  the 
greater Cairo  area  eastwards to Ismailia  and Suez, westwards towards Wadi 
El-Natrun and southwards in the Nile Valley towards Fayoum and Qena; and 
coastal areas on both sides of the Suez Gulf (Fig. 40). 
The overall pattern of prioritization value does not seem to change very 
much  in  the  future,  but  there  are  more  changes  than  when  additive  benefit 
function was used. Under the A2a scenario, prioritization value is predicted to 
decline  by 2020  in El-Gilf  El-Kebir,  around  Farafra  oasis  and south  of  Siwa; 
while  increase  north  of  Siwa,  south  of  the  Qattara  Depression,  around 
Bahariya, south-east  and south-west  of Suez,  east  of El-Gilf El-Kebir (on the 
Sudanese border) and near Hurghada (Figs. 40, 41). By 2050, the pattern of 
prioritization  value  decline  resembles  that  of  2020,  but  with  greater  decline 
around Farafra  oasis,  and  increases  from  around  Fayoum  westwards  to the 
southern  part  of  the  Qattara  Depression,  north  of  the  Qattara  Depression, 
north  of  Siwa,  east  of  El-Gilf  El-Kebir  eastwards  to the Nile  Valley,  the  Red 
Sea  coast  between  west  of  El-Quseir  to  Gebel  El-Gallala,  western  parts  of 
central Sinai and Bir Abraq southwards to small areas of Gebel Elba (Figs. 40, 
41).  By  2080,  the  overall  pattern  of  prioritization  value  change  does  not 
change much from 2050: there are greater declines around Siwa, and smaller 
declines  (and  shrinking  areas)  around  Farafra;  but  increased  prioritization

value  in  both  area  and  amount  in  some  areas,  especially  west  of  Fayoum 
towards the Qattara Depression and east of El-Gilf El-Kebir (Figs. 40, 41). As 
under  the  B2a  scenario,  prioritization  value  is  predicted  to  decline  by  2020 
south  of  Siwa,  around  Farafra,  El-Gilf  El-Kebir,  east  of  Cairo  and  west  of 
Hurghada; while increase north of Siwa, south of the Qattara Depression, east 
of Bahariya, around Fayoum, along the Red Sea coast from Gebel El-Gallala 
to  south-west  of  Safaga,  east  of  El-Gilf  El-Kebir  on  the  Sudanese  border, 
south-east of Aswan and eastern and western parts of central Sinai (Figs. 40, 
41).  By  2050,  prioritization  value  is  predicted  to  decline  in  El-Gilf  El-Kebir, 
south  of  Siwa,  around  Farafra  and  in  between  the  greater  Cairo  and  Suez; 
while increase between Fayoum and south of Fayoum westwards to the Libya 
border, the southern  part  of the Western Desert  near  Sudan,  north  of El-Gilf 
El-Kebir,  Bir  Abraq  southwards  to  Gebel  Elba,  Eastern  Desert  inland  wadis 
from Gebel El-Gallala to Safaga and scattered locations in central Sinai (Figs. 
40, 41). By 2080, prioritization value is predicted to decline in El-Gilf El-Kebir, 
south  of  Siwa,  around  Farafra  and  east  of  Cairo;  while  increase  in  an  area 
extending from Fayoum southwards to El-Minia  and westwards to the Libyan 
border, Red Sea inland wadis from Gebel El-Gallala southwards to El-Quseir, 
Bir  Abraq  southwards  to  Gebel  Elba,  around  the  Nile  valley  from  Edfu 
southwards  and  westwards  (including  Tushka),  and  scattered  locations  in 
central Sinai (Figs. 40, 41). 
Mean  prioritization  value  in  all  cases  were  found  to  be  higher  inside 
Protected Area than outside, with overall a moderate increase predicted in the 
future (except by 2020 under the A2a scenario). The difference in prioritization 
value  between inside  and  outside Protected Areas seems to  be  higher using 
the âcore areaâ rather than the âadditive  benefitâ function,  with slightly smaller 
differences in the future (Figs. 42, 43).

Discussion 
 
Model performance 
From  the  AUC  values,  the  models  of  all  species  discriminated  much  better 
than random; with all species having a mean AUC value greater than 0.7, this 
indicated at least an overall moderate discrimination ability. About 73% of the 
species had a mean AUC value greater than 0.9, indicating high discrimination 
ability (Franklin 2009). The negative correlations found between AUC and the 
area occupied, and with the extent of occurrence, concur with findings of other 
studies  (e.g.  Brotons  et  al.  2004;  Elith  et  al.  2006;  Hernandez  et  al.  2006). 
Species ecological characteristics have been shown to affect model accuracy, 
with  more  localized  or  rarer  species  being  easier  to  model  with  higher 
accuracy than widespread species, regardless of sample size. This is probably 
because rare species are usually habitat specialists, show low environmental 
tolerance,  and  are  environmentally  or  geographically  restricted  compared  to 
widespread species (Stockwell &amp; Peterson 2002; Brotons et al. 2004; Elith et 
al. 2006; Hernandez et al. 2006; JimÃ©nez-Valverde et al. 2008; Franklin et al. 
2009;  Newbold  et  al.  2009b).  Widespread  species  are  more  likely  to  be 
generalists occupying a wide range of habitats and climates, making it difficult 
to distinguish between suitable and unsuitable habitats (Franklin et al. 2009). 
This result may require further scrutiny (Elith et al. 2006), as it is very easy to 
get  high  AUC  scores  when  modelling  species  distributions  with  low  relative 
occurrence area (the proportion between the extent of species records and the 
extent  of  the  study  area  â  i.e.  high  extrapolation)  (JimÃ©nez-Valverde  et  al. 
2008; Lobo et al. 2008). The smaller is the relative occurrence area (localized, 
rare,  or  endemic  species),  the  greater  is  the  number  of  available  absences 
outside the limits of species records and better the model describes the data; 
this  may  be  an  inevitable  result  for  species  with  small  relative  occurrence 
areas  (JimÃ©nez-Valverde  et  al.  2008;  Lobo  et  al.  2008).  Accordingly,  some 
have advised against using AUC to compare model performances of species 
having different relative occurrence areas (Lobo et al. 2008). Given that most 
of the Egyptian herpetofauna (about 60%) are narrowly distributed, occupying 
less than 10% of Egyptâs area (Baha El Din 2006a), this may be the reason for 
- 107 - 
having high mean AUC scores in this study. This is one of the main drawbacks 
of using AUC for testing model accuracy (Lobo et al. 2008). 
There  is  no  evidence  of  a  strong  correlation  between model  accuracy 
and  the  number  of  records  used  to  run  the  models  (see:  Elith  et  al.  2006; 
Newbold et al. 2009b). The weak negative correlation found in this study does 
not concur with the findings of other studies (e.g. Stockwell &amp; Peterson 2002; 
Kadmon  et  al.  2003;  Hernandez  et  al.  2006),  which  found  that  species  with 
larger sample sizes seemed to have higher model accuracy (but see: de Pous 
et al. 2011). A possible reason for my finding is that the  majority  of Egyptian 
reptiles  have  localized  distributions  with  few  records  compared  to  the  large 
study area, resulting in small relative occurrence areas and consequently high 
model performance. 
 
Variables contributing to the models 
Choosing  the  most  appropriate  variables  that  limit  species  distributions  is  a 
challenge  in  many  species  distribution  modelling  studies.  They  should  be 
selected  on  the  basis  that  they  are  ecologically  meaningful  and  have  high 
explanatory  power  (Beaumont  et  al.  2008).  Environmental  variables  are 
substitutes,  in  general,  for  those  variables  that  affects  species  distribution 
directly  through physiological mechanisms, so poor selection  of the variables 
used in the  model (or the unavailability  of data for  variables thought to have 
direct effects on species distributions) may affect the association between the 
species and the climate (AraÃºjo &amp; Peterson 2012). 
In this study, I used available environmental layers thought to have an 
ecological  meaning.  Altitude  was  found  to be the  most  effective  variable for 
many species. The use of the two NDVI variables in the modelling of Egyptian 
reptiles proved to be not very useful, and probably future studies done on the 
same species and scale should not use them. Maximum NDVI was the most 
important variable only for Echis coloratus (although this information should be 
interpreted  with  caution),  with  an  average  permutation  importance  across 
species of 5.2 Â± 5.9. The variable recording the difference between maximum 
and minimum NDVI was not the most important variable for any species, with 
an  average  permutation  importance  across  species  of  2.6  Â±  4.1.  NDVI  has 
- 108 - 
been used in many species distribution modelling studies done on a variety of 
species  groups;  including  mammals  (Torres  et  al.  2010;  Hu  &amp;  Jiang  2011; 
Soultan  2011), reptiles (Zabalaga  2009; Costa  et  al. 2010; Kgosiesele 2010; 
Taheri 2010; Carvalho et al. 2011;  de Pous  et al.  2011; Huang et  al. 2011), 
amphibian  (Tarkhnishvili  et  al.  2009;  Beukema  et  al.  2010),  birds  (Niamir 
2009),  and  even  fungi  (Flory  et  al.  2012).  Some  studies  show  a  high 
importance of NDVI in species distribution modelling applications (e.g. Egbert 
et al. 2002; Anderson et al. 2006; Kgosiesele 2010; Taheri 2010), while others 
show  only  minor  contributions  (e.g.  Torres  et  al.  2010;  Soultan  2011).  In 
Soultanâs study on the effect of climate change on Egyptian antelopes, NDVI 
had only a minor contribution to the models (Soultan 2011). As most of Egypt 
area  is  almost  bare,  except  the  Nile  Valley  and  the  Nile  Delta,  a  large 
proportion of Egypt has very small NDVI values, making their use in modelling 
Egyptian fauna questionable. 
The habitat map produced by the BioMAP project seems to have made 
only  a  low  contribution  to  the  reptile  models  (with  an  average  permutation 
importance  across species  of 3.9  Â±  5.1), the most important  variable for just 
one  species  (Leptotyphlops  macrorhynchus).  This  may  be  because  of  the 
series of conversions and rescaling processes that converted it from vector to 
a relatively  coarse raster  format,  or  because many  of  the  habitat  categories 
are correlated with other variables, such as altitude. 
Neither  slope  nor  aspect  were  used  to  run the  models,  although  they 
are thought to affect the reptile distributions. They have been used in two other 
species  distribution  modelling  studies  done  on  Egyptian  antelopes  and  a 
relatively  high contributions  to  the  final  models  were  found (El Alqamy  et  al. 
2010;  Soultan  2011).  Having  an  average  indication  of  either  slope  or  aspect 
across Egypt at the coarse resolution used here (~ 5 km) seems not to be that 
helpful. Giving  just  one  value for  either  of them  on  a grid  of 25-km
2
 squares 
does not provide accurate information (especially with the moderate degree of 
uncertainty  associated  with some  species  records).  Involving  them  in  further 
studies  at  smaller  scales  may  be  more  useful;  these  would  need  high-
resolution  variables  and  records  with  only  minor  levels  of  positional 
uncertainty.

Species richness and turnover 
The pattern of species richness of the Egyptian herpetofauna from this study is 
consistent  with  the  findings  of  (Baha  El Din  2006a  -  see  Fig.  44).  The  main 
pattern of herpetofauna hotspots in Egypt was found to be around the greater 
Cairo (including  Wadi  El-Natrun  and Fayoum  area), North  Sinai,  Gebel Elba 
area, and margins of Nile Delta eastwards to the Suez Canal area. Despite the 
high degree of concordance, this study shows fewer numbers of species in the 
high mountains of South Sinai, the Gebel Elba area and the western parts of 
the Mediterranean coast.

per  a  grid  of  half  degree,  comparing  the  results  of  (Baha  El  Din 
2006a) (left) to the results of this study (right). 
 
The  current  predicted  pattern  of  species  richness  (using  either 
probability or thresholded distributions) is consistent with the recorded species 
richness,  but  gives  more  emphasis  to  the  Suez  Canal  area,  western 
Mediterranean  coast,  both sides  of  the  Suez  Gulf  and  a narrow  strip  across 
the  northern part  of  the Nile  Delta.  Gathering  information  from  other studies 
discussing the species richness pattern of different taxonomic groups in Egypt 
is very helpful to show which areas share highest biodiversity or require more 
protection. Although produced with different methodologies, adding up species 
richness  maps  of  this  study  to  those  of  butterflies  and  mammals  (Gilbert  &amp; 
Zalat  2008;  Basuony  et  al.  2010)  indicates  the  most  important  biodiversity 
areas.  Using  the  accumulated  pattern  of  species  richness  of  these  three 
groups, the hotspots of biodiversity were at the periphery of greater Cairo, in 
the high mountain  areas  of South Sinai, the coastal  areas  of the Aqaba  and 
- 110 - 
Suez  gulfs,  the  Suez  Canal  area  and  the  narrow  strip  on  the  Mediterranean 
coast from Rafah to Sallum (Fig. 45). A separate study is probably needed to 
focus  on  producing  such  a  map  using  one  consistent  methodology  and  a 
greater variety  of species  groups,  to show  areas  of highest species richness 
across Egypt.

(butterflies, mammals, and reptiles), showing areas of high species 
richness. Species richness maps for butterflies and mammals were

2010) 
 
There are no published studies known to me that discuss the effect of 
climate change on Egyptian reptiles (see above), obviating any comparison of 
main  findings  of  this  study  to  others.  Information  on  the  reptiles  in  adjacent 
countries  (e.g.  Sudan  and  Libya)  is  very  limited,  making  it  not  possible  to 
compare  patterns  of  species  distributions,  or  make  assumptions  about 
possible  compensations  or  migrations  of  Egyptian  reptiles  as  a  result  of 
climate change. Areas predicted to lose a high number of species in the future 
(and so potentially require more attention; assuming either dispersal abilities) 
are the Suez Canal area, coastal  areas  of both Suez  and Aqaba  gulfs, Wadi 
El-Natrun, around the greater Cairo, Siwa oasis and small inland wadis of the 
Red Sea. Other areas are predicted to benefit from climate change, increasing 
their number of species (assuming unlimited dispersal); these include the area 
between  the  west  Mediterranean  coast  to  the  Qattara  Depression,  middle  to 
north Sinai, Red Sea coastal areas, Western Desert oases, and southern parts 
of the Nile Valley (for more details, see above). This indicates that some areas 
- 111 - 
with currently high predicted species richness  may  lose many species in the 
future; some  of these  areas  are already under  a certain degree  of  protection 
and  so  it  might  be  easier  to  maintain  them  in  the  future  (e.g.  Siwa  oasis). 
Others (e.g. Wadi El-Natrun, the Suez Canal area and Red Sea inland wadis) 
are unprotected and measures are needed to conserve them (see later). The 
Qattara  Depression  may  benefit  from  species  shifting  away  from  Siwa  and 
Wadi  El-Natrun;  some  species  from  inland  Red  Sea  wadis  are  predicted  to 
shift  eastwards to Red  Sea coastal  areas. This  is not likely to happen in the 
near future because  of the  limited  dispersal  ability  of  most  Egyptian reptiles. 
For  a  country  like  Egypt  with  limited  resources  and  budgets  dedicated  to 
wildlife  conservation,  attention  and  effort  may  have  to  be  concentrated  in 
important  areas  that  are  predicted  to  lose  species  in  the  future,  rather  than 
expanding the current Protected Areas network to cover those areas predicted 
to  increase  species  richness  in  the  future,  especially  since  most  reptiles 
probably  cannot  track  suitable  climatic  conditions  in  the  near  future.  Some 
areas  with increased  species  richness  in the  future  are not  well-investigated 
yet  (e.g.  the  Qattara  Depression)  and  more  research  is  required  to  indicate 
their need for protection. 
There is only one comparable study of the impact of climate change on 
Egyptian  taxa  -  that  of  Leach  (2011)  on  mammals  and  butterflies.  The 
predicted  future  changes  in  species  richness  as  a  result  of  climate  change 
from my study do not seem to concur with Leachâs. Mammal species richness 
is predicted to decline in the Mediterranean and Red Sea areas (40-60%) and 
increase  elsewhere  (80-100%);  while  for  butterflies  almost  all  of  Egypt  is 
predicted  to  decline  (40-60%)  except  southern  Egypt  which  is  predicted  to 
increase (40-60%) (Leach 2011). 
  Species  richness  by  itself  is  not  adequate  as  an  indicator  of  biotic 
change. It is possible to maintain the same number of species in the future, yet 
change in species composition. The largest change in species composition in 
the future is predicted to be in the great area of the Western Desert (including 
the  oases,  El-Gilf  El-Kebir  area,  and  the  area  between  Wadi  El-Natrun,  the 
Mediterranean coast, the Qattara Depression and Siwa oasis), inland wadis of 
the Eastern Desert and Gebel El-Hallal area. No other studies have discussed 
- 112 - 
the  potential  change  in  future  species  composition  in  Egypt  as  a  result  of 
climate change.  
Fairly similar results are evident in other studies performed on different 
continents or taxonomic groups. In his study on the effect of climate change on 
the  European  reptiles,  de  Pous  (2011)  predicted  high  species  loss  and 
turnover in  a  priority  conservation  hotspot  in  Europe  (the  Iberian  Peninsula), 
with  great  variation  in  the  predicted  patterns  of  future  species  richness  and 
species loss across different future projections. The same study predicted high 
species turnover in most parts of Europe except the central areas (assuming 
unlimited dispersal),  while such areas under  limited dispersal  were restricted 
to three relatively small areas (de Pous 2011). Ihlow et al. (2012) predicted  a 
strong effect of climate change on global chelonian species richness, with the 
highest  impact  on  four  current  chelonian  hotspots,  possibly  because  of  non-
analogous  climate  conditions  in  the  future.  According  to  Maiorano  et  al. 
(2011),  mammal species richness  of the Mediterranean basin is  predicted to 
have  important  changes  in  the  future  due  to  climate  change;  with  highest 
predicted  species  richness  decline  and  highest  species  turnover  in  Spain, 
North Africa and the Middle East. In another study, Currie (2001) predicted the 
effect  of  climate  change  on  species  richness  patterns  in  trees  and  different 
vertebrate  groups  in the  conterminous  United  States.  Climate change  had  a 
variable  effect  on  different  groups:  the  response  of  trees  was  variable,  but 
severe effects were predicted on birds and mammals, while potential benefits 
were predicted for reptiles and amphibians (Currie 2001). A combination of  a 
temperature  increase  of  3Â°  C  and  a  20%  decline  in  rainfall  was  predicted  to 
lead  to  the  loss  of  about  15%  of  species  richness  in  the  tropical  forests  of 
Mesoamerica (Golicher et al. 2012).  
 
Range Changes &amp; important species for conservation 
Two species are predicted to loss their entire suitable habitats in at least one 
future  projection:  Tarentola  mindiae  and  Hemidactylus  robustus.  Tarentola 
mindiae  is  a  near  endemic  species  recorded  just  from  northwest  Egypt  and 
northern  Cyrenaica  (eastern  Libya);  its  distribution  in  Egypt  is  restricted  to 
Siwa oasis, the Qattara Depression and their periphery (Baha El Din 2006a - 
- 113 - 
see  Fig.  46(a)).  According  to  the  IUCN,  it  is  classified  globally  as  Least 
Concern (Baha El Din 2006c), and nationally as Vulnerable in this study (due 
its  limited  number  of  locations).  From  the  future range changes  predicted  in 
this study, it is classified as Endangered by 2020 and as Critically Endangered 
by 2050 and 2080 (under all emission scenarios and dispersal assumptions). 
Modelling the  current  distribution  of  Tarentola  mindiae shows  that  its  current 
suitable areas are at Siwa oasis and the Qattara Depression, with unconfirmed 
possible  suitability  in  Wadi  El-Natrun,  El-Omayed  protectorate,  and  Lake 
Qarun  &amp;  Wadi  El-Rayan  protectorates  in  the  Fayoum  area.  Further 
investigation on the existence of Tarentola mindiae in Fayoum area and Wadi 
El-Natrun is required, although it is unlikely to be found there due to extensive 
collecting  efforts  done  in  these  areas  without  recording  it.  The  existing 
Protected  Area  of  Siwa  has  a  high  conservation  responsibility  for  Tarentola 
mindiae.  Constructing  a  new  Protected  Area  in  the  easternmost  part  of  the 
Qattara  Depression  (or  expansion  of  El-Omayed  protectorate  southwards) 
seems to be important to conserve this species. 
  Hemidactylus  robustus  is  a  localized  species  that  ranges  from  East 
Africa  coast  from  Zanzibar  to  southern  Egypt,  Arabia,  east  to  Pakistan;  its 
distribution in Egypt is on the Red Sea coast from El-Quseir southwards (Baha 
El Din 2006a - Fig. 46(b)). Hemidactylus robustus has not been classified yet 
for  the  IUCN  Red  List,  and  classified  nationally  as  Vulnerable  based  on  its 
limited  number  of  locations.  Under A2a scenario,  it  is  classified  as  Critically 
Endangered  by  2020  and  2050  and  predicted  to  maintain  part  of  its  lost 
distribution by 2080 (assuming either dispersal assumptions); while under B2a 
scenario, it is classified as Endangered by 2020 and as Critically Endangered 
by 2050 and 2080 (assuming either dispersal assumptions). More than half of 
its  current  distribution  in  Egypt  is  located  within  Wadi  El-Gemal  and  Gebel 
Elba Protected Areas, which indicates that it is hypothetically protected. Both 
protectorates (northwards towards Safaga  on the Red Sea coast) have  great 
responsibility to conserve this species, and such threatened species should be 
taken  in  consideration  before  giving  permission  for  any  new  development 
activities (e.g. tourism) near the Red Sea coast, especially in Wadi El-Gemal 
protectorate. If it is recorded there at high prevalence, a suggested expansion 
of  either  Protected  Areas  is  required  to  cover  unprotected  coastal  zone 
- 114 - 
between  both  protectorates  (north  and  south  of  Berenice),  although  the 
protection of this area should already be the concern of both protectorates as 
it is located very close to their buffer zone. No information is available on the 
distribution  or  the  status  of  Hemidactylus  robustus  in  the  coastal  areas  of 
Sudan, so possible compensation from the south is not clear. 
Other  than  Tarentola  mindiae,  there  are  other  eleven  endemic/near-
endemic  reptile  species.  Three  are  endemic  to  Egypt:  Hemidactylus  foudaii, 
Mesalina bahaeldini and Tropiocolotes bisharicus; and eight are near-endemic 
to Egypt: Acanthodactylus aegyptius, A. pardalis, Philochortus zolii, Platyceps 
sinai,  Telescopus  hoogstraali,  Testudo  kleinmanni,  Trapelus  savignii  and 
Tropiocolotes  nubicus.  Mesalina  bahaeldini  is  a  common  and  widespread 
species that has a world distribution confined to high mountains of South Sinai 
(Baha  El  Din  2006a).  It  is  classified  as  Least  Concern  by  IUCN  (Werner  &amp; 
Baha  El  Din  2006a)  and  as  Vulnerable  in  this  study  (because  of  limited 
number  of  locations).  Climate change is  predicted  to have  mild  effect  on  its 
distribution,  ranging  from  up  to  50%  suitability  gain  (assuming  unlimited 
dispersal) to up to 50% suitability loss (âEndangeredâ - assuming no dispersal).  
Hemidactylus  foudaii  is  a  rare  and  localized  species  that  has  a  world 
distribution  restricted  to  the  Gebel  Elba  region  (Baha  El  Din  2006a).  It  is 
classified  by  IUCN  as  Least  Concern  (Baha  El  Din  2006b)  and  was  not 
assessed nationally in this study due to its limited number of records, although 
it probably should be classified at least as Vulnerable due to its limited number 
of  locations.  It  was  not  possible  to  assess  the  potential  effect  of  climate 
change on the distribution of Hemidactylus foudaii due to the limited number of 
available records.  
Tropiocolotes  bisharicus  has  a  distribution  confined  to  southeast  of 
Egypt, although its range is likely to extend southwards into Sudan along the 
Red Sea (Baha El Din 2006a). It has not yet been classified for the IUCN Red 
List, and was classified as Vulnerable in this study. Climate change seems to 
have  mild  effect  on  its  future  distribution  that  ranges  from  small  gain  (up  to 
30% - assuming unlimited dispersal) to up to 30% loss of its suitable habitats 
(âLeast Concernâ), reaching up to 50% loss (âVulnerableâ) by  2080 under A2a 
scenario (assuming no-dispersal). Almost all the world distribution of Mesalina 
- 115 - 
bahaeldini  is  within  the  St.  Katherine  Protectorate;  this  gives  great 
responsibility  to  St.  Katherine  to  conserve  the  species.  Gebel  Elba 
Protectorate  has  the  responsibility  for  conserving  the  whole  world  range  of 
both Hemidactylus foudaii and Tropiocolotes bisharicus. 
The status of the Egyptian tortoise, Testudo kleinmanni, is a well-known 
issue in Egypt wildlife conservation, and several studies have been carried out 
within the last ten years on its conservation status (e.g.: Geffen 1990; Baha El 
Din et al. 2003; PerÃ¤lÃ¤ 2006; Attum et al. 2007). Testudo kleinmanni is a near-
endemic  species  restricted  to  southeastern  corner  of  the  Mediterranean, 
extending as a narrow strip from the western Negev in the east westwards to 
the  Gulf  of  Sirt  in  Libya  (Geffen  1990;  Baha  El  Din  2006a).  It  is  one  of  the 
smallest and most endangered tortoise species in the Mediterranean basin of 
North Africa and the Middle East, with the most restricted range of all tortoises 
in  this  area  (Attum  et  al.  2007).  All  available  records  for  this  species  from 
Egypt (including historic records) are shown in Fig. 46(k). The current realized 
range  of  this  species  is  currently  very  limited,  as  it  has  been  subjected  to 
severe  pressures  in  the  near  past  causing  the  extirpation  of  its  former 
distribution  range  (Baha  El  Din  2006a).  Reasons  for  its  range  reduction 
include severe over-grazing, over-collecting for pet-trade, massive reclamation 
schemes,  and  extensive  habitat  destruction  accompanied  with  coastal 
development  for  tourism  and  urban  expansion  (Geffen  1990;  Baha  El  Din 
2006a;  Attum  et  al.  2007).  It  is  considered  by  some  authors  as  effectively 
extinct  within  Egypt  between  the  early  1970s  and  the  early  1990s  (PerÃ¤lÃ¤ 
2003) until two female tortoises were confiscated by an animal collector inside 
El-Omayed Protectorate  in  2003 (Attum  et al.  2007). It seems still to exist  in 
the  wild  in  low  populations  in  two  Protected  Areas;  Zaranik  and  El-Omayed 
(Mindy Baha El-Din, pers. comm.). It is classified globally by IUCN as Critically 
Endangered [A2abcd+3d] (PerÃ¤lÃ¤  2003)  and  as Vulnerable (D2) in this study 
(just  owing to its  very  limited number  of locations). In this study,  all available 
Egyptian  records  of  Testudo  kleinmanni  were  used  to  model  its  suitable 
habitats  in  the  current  and  future.  The  results  show  low  impact  of  future 
climate  change  on  the  distribution  of  Testudo  kleinmanni;  the  effect  ranges 
from  gaining  up  to  50%  more  than  its  historical  distribution  (assuming 
unlimited  dispersal)  to  the  loss  of  less  than  30%  of  its  historical  distribution 
- 116 - 
(âLeast Concernâ - assuming no-dispersal). This shows that climate change is 
not  really  a  major  threat,  except  possible  future  habitat  destruction  from  the 
predicted  rise  in  sea  level  of  the  Mediterranean  Sea.  Suitable  areas  for  the 
distribution  of  Testudo  kleinmanni  (shown  in  Fig.  46-k)  should  not  be 
interpreted as the current predicted distribution of it, but may be considered as 
potential  areas for re-introduction. The current status of the Egyptian tortoise 
in Libya is not clear, although it seems to exist there in higher numbers than in 
Egypt. The major threat for the Libyan populations seems to be over-collection 
for  the  pet-trade,  with  several  confiscations  of  dozens  of  individuals  in  pet 
markets  (Mindy  Baha  El-Din,  pers.  comm.).  There  are  a number  of  captive-
breeding  tortoises  in  two  enclosures  in  Egypt  where  upward  of  70  tortoises 
breed annually (Mindy Baha El-Din, pers. comm.). A separate study is needed 
using  the  Egyptian  tortoiseâs  available  records  from  Egypt  and  the  adjacent 
countries to construct a robust model that show the most effective locations for 
re-introduction. In such a study, layers indicating the habitat status of the study 
area  (the  Mediterranean  coast  area  extending  from  the  Negev  towards  the 
Libyan Mediterranean coast) should be used if available. Such layers include 
current  land-uses  (e.g.  agriculture,  tourism,  etc.),  protection  status 
(protected/non-protected), and the habitat destruction status. Areas which are 
not suitable any more for re-introduction should be excluded as not to interfere 
with the model; this includes some areas on the Egyptian Mediterranean coast 
that  have  already  suffered  from  severe  habitat  destruction  in  the  past,  and 
areas with high human populations. 
Trapelus savignii  has  a very small  world range,  existing  in just Egypt, 
Palestine and Israel, with most of its world distribution lying within Egypt (Baha 
El Din 2006a). Its distribution in Egypt is narrow, occupying the area from east 
of  Cairo  eastwards  through  northern  Eastern  Desert  towards  much  of  north 
Sinai (Baha El Din 2006a). It is classified  as Vulnerable  by IUCN (Werner &amp; 
Baha  El  Din  2006b)  and  also  nationally  in  this  study.  Potential  impacts  of 
climate  change  on  the  distribution  of  Trapelus  savignii  seem  to  be  minor; 
ranging  from  gaining  up  to  more  than  100%  of  its  current  occupancy 
(assuming  unlimited  dispersal)  to  the  loss  of  less  than  30%  of  its  current 
occupancy (âLeast Concernâ - assuming no dispersal).

Acanthodactylus  pardalis  has  a  restricted  distribution  confined  to 
northwest  Egypt  and  northern  Cyrenaica in  Libya;  its  distribution  in  Egypt  is 
narrow,  extending  from  Cairo  and  Fayoum  northwestwards  towards  Sallum, 
across  the  Mediterranean  coast  (Baha  El  Din  2006a).  It  is  classified  as 
Vulnerable by IUCN (BÃ¶hme &amp; Baha El Din 2006a) and also nationally in this 
study.  This  species  is  considered  one  of  Egyptâs  most  threatened  reptiles 
species  and  has  disappeared recently from its previous  distribution (Baha El 
Din 2006a). Habitat degradation and loss (because of large-scale plowing for 
winter cereals agriculture and extensive tourism development), over-collection 
pressure and over-grazing are the major factors causing the destruction of its 
suitable  habitats  between  Alexandria  and  Mersa  Matruh,  leaving  reasonably 
healthy  populations  just  between  Mersa  Matruh  and  Sallum  (Baha  El  Din 
2006a).  Potential  impacts  of  climate  change  on  the  distribution  of 
Acanthodactylus pardalis seem to be  minor; ranging from gaining up to 80% 
(assuming unlimited dispersal) to the loss of less than 30% of suitable habitats 
(âLeast Concernâ - assuming no dispersal).  
Acanthodactylus aegyptius has a restricted distribution that is confined 
to Egypt, northwest  of the Negev  and the Gaza strip; its distribution in Egypt 
includes North Sinai, the northernmost part of the Eastern Desert, throughout 
the northern Western Desert (including Bahariya and Kharga oases, Wadi El-
Natrun  and the  easternmost  edge of the Qattara Depression),  and along the 
west periphery  of the Nile Valley  (Baha  El Din 2007);  and has been recently 
recorded  from  the  west  of  Farafra Oasis  (Werner &amp;  Ashkenazi  2010).  It has 
not  been  assessed  yet  for  IUCN  Red  List,  possibly  because  of  its  recent 
recognition as new species by (Baha El Din 2007), and is classified as Least 
Concern  in  this  study.  A  moderately  high  impact  of  climate  change  on  the 
distribution of Acanthodactylus aegyptius is predicted, with a potential loss of 
up  to  50%  of  its  current  suitable  habitat  by  2050  (âEndangeredâ  -  under  all 
emission  scenarios  and  dispersal  ability  assumptions),  reaching  up  to  80% 
loss  by  2080  under  the  A2a  scenario  (âCritically  Endangeredâ  -  no-dispersal 
assumption).  
Philochortus zolii is recorded from just three widely separated locations 
in  Egypt  and  southwest  Libya,  with  a  very  restricted  distribution  in  Egypt 
confined to very small saltmarsh tracts  at Wadi El-Natrun  area  (Baha  El Din 
- 118 - 
2006a). It is classified by IUCN as Critically Endangered [B1ab(iii)] because of 
its  presumably  small  extent  of  occurrence  (&lt;100  km
2
),  its  fragmented 
distribution,  and  severe  habitat  destruction  and  quality  decline  in  Egypt  and 
presumably in Libya (BÃ¶hme &amp; Baha El Din 2006b). It is considered to be the 
most threatened reptile species in Egypt, due to imminent habitat destruction 
of  Wadi  El-Natrun  area  and  the  pressure  of  over-collection  (Baha  El  Din 
2006a).  
Telescopus  hoogstraali  has  a  small  global  geographical  distribution 
including  just  Sinai,  the  Negev  and  Jordan;  with  a  rare  and  localized 
distribution  in Egypt confined to St. Katherine  area  and Gebel El-Maghara in 
Sinai (Baha  El Din 2006a). It is classified by  IUCN  as Endangered  [B1ab(iii)] 
because  of  its  small  extent  of  occurrence  (&lt;5000  km
2
),  its  fragmented 
distribution, and the continuing decline in the extent and habitat quality (Disi et 
al. 2006).  
Tropiocolotes  nubicus  has  a  world  distribution  confined  to  Egypt  and 
Sudan; with a restricted distribution immediately bordering the southern part of 
the Nile Valley (Baha El Din 2006a). It is classified as Data Deficient by IUCN 
as  it  has  been  recently  described  and  its  full  range,  status,  threats  and 
ecological requirements are uncertain (Bohm &amp; Richman 2010).  
Platyceps  sinai  is  restricted  to  a  small  geographic  area  including  just 
South Sinai, the Negev and Jordan; it has a rare and localized distribution in 
Egypt  and  considered  a  near  threatened  species  in  Egypt  (Baha  El  Din 
2006a). It has not been yet classified for IUCN Red List.  
Available  number  of records for  each of Philochortus zolii, Telescopus 
hoogstraali,  Tropiocolotes  nubicus  and  Platyceps  sinai  was  inadequate  to 
involve them  in  this  study  analyses;  and  hence  their  national  Red  Data  List 
status and the potential impacts of climate change on their distribution can not 
be assessed.  
Zaranik  and  El-Omayed  protectorates  have  the  responsibility  to 
conserve  the  remaining  populations  of  Testudo  kleinmanni  and  to  urge  the 
halting  of  habitat  degradation  around  their  peripheries.  Zaranik  is  the  only 
Egyptian protectorate (with the possible exception of Al-Ahrash) that contains 
Trapelus savignii, giving it greater responsibility to conserve this species. The 
- 119 - 
current distribution  of Acanthodactylus aegyptius is included in  a  two  already 
established  Protected  Areas,  Zaranik  and Wadi  El-Rayan,  which  means  that 
the  populations  at  those  protectorates  are  potentially  protected.  The 
construction of Protected Areas in Wadi El-Natrun and the easternmost part of 
the  Qattara  Depression  can  offer  an  additive  help  in  its  conservation.  The 
current  limited  distribution  of  Acanthodactylus  pardalis  in  Egypt  does  not 
include  any  Protected  Areas.  The  construction  of  a  Protected  Area  on  the 
Mediterranean  coast  between  Mersa  Matruh  and  Sallum  seems  to  be 
essential  for  its  conservation.  Alternatively,  the  expansion  of  the  recently 
declared  marine  protectorate,  El-Sallum  Gulf  to  cover  threatened  habitats 
along  the  western  part  of  the  Mediterranean  coast  could  be  a  measure  to 
protect  this  species.  The  construction  of  a  Protected  Area  in  the  Wadi  El-
Natrun  area seems  to be essential for  the conservation  of Philochortus zolii. 
Protected Areas of South Sinai have the responsibility for the conservation of 
Telescopus hoogstraali and Platyceps sinai; with a possible need to construct 
a  new  Protected  Area  in the  region  of  Gebel El-Maghara close  to  Gebel  El-
Hallal  in  North  Sinai  to  conserve  Telescopus  hoogstraali.  The  current 
distribution  of  Tropiocolotes  nubicus  does  not  include  any  Protected  Areas, 
and so it is assumed not to be protected. Unfortunately, the construction of a 
new Protected Area in the area of lower Nile seems not to be possible due to 
the high number of inhabitants and its extensive agricultural activities. 
Eight  species  are  classified  as  Critically  Endangered  in  at  least  one 
mean  future  projection:  Acanthodactylus  longipes,  Cerastes  vipera,  Eryx 
jaculus,  Eumeces  schneiderii,  Malpolon  moilensis,  Ptyodactylus  guttatus, 
P.siphonorhina  and Trapelus  mutabilis (For detailed results, see  above). The 
conservation  of  these species  should  be considered  in Egyptâs  conservation 
management  plans.  Maps  showing  the  current  distribution  of  each  of  these 
species and their predicted suitable habitats are shown in Fig. 46. 
In this study, three reptile species are classified nationally, according to IUCN 
red  list,  as  Endangered:  Chamaeleo  africanus,  Leptotyphlops  cairi  and 
Uromastyx ocellata. The three species have a narrow distribution in Egypt and 
globally.  First  two  are  not  classified  yet  by  IUCN,  while  the  third,  Uromastyx 
ocellata, is classified as Least Concern (Spawls 2011). There is no predicted 
impact  of  climate  change  on  their  future  distributions,  except  for  Uromastyx 
- 120 - 
ocellata which is predicted to loss up to 50% (Vulnerable) of its distribution by 
2080 due to climate change. 
Other studies discussing predicted future range changes as a result of 
climate change show fairly similar results. AraÃºjo et al. (2006)  predicted less 
deleterious  impacts  of  climate  change  than  expected  beforehand  for  the 
amphibia  and  reptiles  of  Europe,  with  most  species  tending  to  expand  their 
distributions in the future (assuming unlimited dispersal) due to the warming of 
the  cooler  northern  parts  of  Europe,  allowing  new  colonization.  They 
suggested  that  the  highest  loss  of  suitability,  assuming  unlimited  dispersal, 
was  in  the  south-western  parts  of  Europe  (including  the  Iberian  Peninsula), 
while  south-eastern  parts  were  predicted  high  species  gain.  Under  the 
perhaps  more  realistic  assumption  of  no  dispersal,  most  species  were 
predicted  losses in habitat suitability  by  2050 (AraÃºjo  et  al.  2006). In a  more 
recent relevant study, de Pous (2011) predicted that under unlimited dispersal, 
50%  of  European  reptile  species  should  tend  to  expand  in  the  future,  while 
assuming no dispersal predicted that 78% of species would contract. de Pous 
(2011) suggested that eight (unlimited dispersal) or 21 (no dispersal) speceis 
would become extinct in at least one future projection, and a further two were 
consistently projected to undergo &gt; 80% loss of their currently suitable habitats 
(Iberolacerta  bonnali  and  Podarcis  tiliguerta).  Compared  with  the  predicted 
responses  of  Egyptian  reptiles  in  this  study,  de  Pous  (2011)  suggests  that 
European  species  will suffer  more from  climate  change.  There  are no  other 
comparable studies from North Africa or the Middle East. 
From their comprehensive study of the potential responses of terrestrial 
mammals  in  the  Mediterranean  basin  to  climate  change,  Maiorano  et  al. 
(2011) suggested that a substantial number of Mediterranean mammals will be 
severely threatened by 2100, particularly some endemics. Assuming unlimited 
dispersal, responses ranged between 100% loss to substantial gains (almost 
ten-fold)  of currently suitable habitats. One species  was predicted to lose its 
entire suitable  habitat  across all scenarios  and models,  and 16 species were 
predicted  to  become  extinct in at least  one future projection (Maiorano et al. 
2011).  As  before,  assuming  no  dispersal  led  to  greater  losses  and  more 
modest gains, with 21 species predicted to lose their entire suitable habitats in 
at least one future projection (Maiorano et al. 2011). 
- 121 - 
The  study  by  Ihlow  et  al.  (2012)  predicted  that  climate  change  would 
cause the range contraction of 86% of the global chelonian species, with about 
12%  of  the  species  predicted  to  be  completely  located  outside  their  current 
realized niche. Sauer et al. (2011) suggested a predicted average range loss 
of  70-80%  of  freshwater  assemblages  within  low  mountain  ranges  by  2080; 
range change varied from almost complete loss to  modest gains  of currently 
suitable  habitats.  Similar  results  were  found  by  Domisch  et  al.  (2011)  on 
macroinvertebrates  of  the  submontane  regions  of  Central  Europe,  with 
predicted  extinction  of  one species to substantial range gains  of  others.  Ben 
Rais Lasram  et  al. (2010)  predicted  a severe impact  of climate change  on  a 
large number of Mediterranean fish species, with 25 and 45 species predicted 
to  be  listed  on  the  IUCN  Red  List  by  2060  and  2100,  respectively.  They 
predicted that 6 and 14 fish species would become extinct by 2060 and 2100, 
respectively,  and  that  the  ranges  of  endemic  species  would  become  highly 
fragmented in the future. 
 
Area prioritization for conservation &amp; Protected Areas coverage 
In  my study, Protected  Areas had  higher mean prioritization  value  (currently, 
and  in  the  future) compared  to  outside  the  protectorates  using  both  additive 
benefit  and  core  area  functions  of  the  Zonation  algorithm.  Using  additive 
benefit function, areas with current high prioritization value are the Suez Canal 
area,  the  Nile  Valley  and  its  Delta,  the  Qattara  Depression,  high  elevation 
wadis in South Sinai, and the coastal areas of the Red Sea, the Mediterranean 
Sea  and  the  Aqaba  &amp;  Suez  Gulfs.  These  areas  also  show  high  species 
richness,  reflecting  the  nature  of  additive  benefit  function  which  gives  more 
weight  to locations  with  high species  richness  (Moilanen  et  al.  2012).  Using 
core-area  function,  areas  with  current  high  prioritization  values  are  high 
elevation wadis in South Sinai, Gebel Elba, Siwa oasis, the Suez Canal area, 
the Red Sea coast, the Mediterranean coast and the Nile Valley. There is not 
much  difference  between  the  overall  patterns  of  areas  of  high  prioritization 
value  using  either  function,  with  overall  higher  prioritization  value  using 
additive benefit function (especially along the north Mediterranean coast from 
Sallum  to Rafah,  Wadi  El-Natrun,  Suez  Canal  area  and  around Cairo).  This 
- 122 - 
result is not as expected; using core-area function should identify important (or 
poor)  locations  where  a  single  or  a  few  species  have  important  occurrences 
(Moilanen  et  al.  2012),  and  this  should  not  be  affected  by  the  pattern  of 
species  richness  unless  these  high  species-richness  locations  also  contain 
important occurrences of single or few species. 
In the future, a higher prioritization value is predicted to be given to the 
area  between  Bir  Abraq  and  Gebel  Elba,  Gebel  El-Gallala  southwards, 
Western  Desert  oases,  western  part  of  middle  Sinai  and  an  area  extending 
from inland areas of the Mediterranean coast to the Qattara Depression. It is 
predicted  also  that  areas  outside  the  protectorates  will  have  higher  mean 
prioritization  value  in  the  future  (especially  using  Additive  benefit  function), 
although  the  mean  prioritization  value  of  Protected  Areas  is  predicted  to 
remain higher than outside them (Figs. 42, 43).  
Although  Protected  Areas  show  higher  mean  prioritization  value  than 
outside  them,  Egyptâs  Protected  Area  network  seems  to  be  inadequate  to 
conserve  Egyptian  reptiles.  New  Protected  Areas  may  be  needed  to  cover 
unprotected  areas  with  high  species  richness  in  the  middle  to  north  Sinai 
(especially around the Gebel El-Hallal area), the Suez Canal area, both sides 
of Suez Gulf and Red Sea inland wadis between Hurghada and Mersa Alam. 
Stricter protection is required in already-established Protected Areas, including 
Gebel Elba, Siwa oasis and the Protected Areas in South Sinai. In the future, 
further protection is needed in areas of the Suez Canal, coasts of South Sinai, 
Wadi El-Natrun,  and Red Sea inland wadis;  and stricter protection  measures 
in already established Protected Areas, such as Siwa and Gebel Elba. 
Regarding  the  potential  future  change  in  species  composition,  more 
attention should be given to the already-established Protected Areas predicted 
to  have  high  species  turnover  in  the  future,  e.g.  Siwa  oasis  and  El-Gilf  El-
Kebir.  More  attention  is  also  needed  in  areas  with  current  high  species 
richness which are predicted to have high species turnover in the future, such 
as Wadi El-Natrun, the Gebel El-Hallal area and inland wadis in the Red Sea: 
these areas may need new Protected Areas. Special concern should be given 
as  well  to  unprotected  areas  with high  prioritization  value;  such  as  the  Suez 
Canal area, the Qattara Depression, and the coastal areas of the Red Sea, the 
- 123 - 
Mediterranean  Sea  and  the  Aqaba  and  Suez  gulfs.  For  already-established 
Protected Areas having high prioritization value, stricter protection is required 
to maintain these areas, e.g. Gebel Elba, the Protected Areas in South Sinai 
and  the  Protected  Areas  near  Western  Desert  oases.  More  fieldwork  is 
required  to  show  the  current  status  of  areas  predicted  to  have  increased 
prioritization value in the future, to evaluate their conservation status and show 
if any of these areas should be declared as new Protected Areas; e.g. Gebel 
El-Gallala,  Gebel  El-Hallal  and  the  Qattara  Depression.  Further  fieldwork  is 
also needed in unprotected areas that contain threatened species, to show if 
any  of these areas  are worth considering  as  new  protectorates. The Qattara 
Depression  seems  to  be  one  of  these  areas,  considered  important  for  the 
conservation  of  Acanthodactylus  aegyptius,  A.  longipes,  Cerastes  vipera, 
Eumeces  schneiderii,  Malpolon  moilensis,  Ptyodactylus  siphonorhina, 
Tarentola  mindiae  and  Trapelus  mutabilis.  Other  such  sites  are  Wadi  El-
Natrun  for  Acanthodactylus  aegyptius,  Cerastes  vipera,  Malpolon  moilensis, 
Philochortus  zolii,  Ptyodactylus  siphonorhina  and  Trapelus  mutabilis  (and 
possibly  Tarentola  mindiae);  the  Gebel  El-Hallal  area  for  Cerastes  vipera, 
Malpolon  moilensis  and  Ptyodactylus  guttatus  (and  possibly  Telescopus 
hoogstraali);  the  Suez  Gulf  coasts  for  Malpolon  moilensis,  Cerastes  vipera, 
Hemidactylus robustus and Ptyodactylus guttatus; and the western part of the 
Mediterranean coast (between Mersa Matruh and Sallum) for the conservation 
of Acanthodactylus pardalis. 
The  area  of  the  Qattara  Depression  is  unexplored  and  not  easy  to 
access. It is one of a number of proposed new Protected Areas characterized 
by high habitat diversity and very high degree of threat (Baha El Din 1998). It 
has  the  highest  priority  among  the  proposed  protectorates,  as  it  supports 
considerable  biodiversity  including  rare  and  endangered  species,  and  is 
considered the last refuge for several endangered key species for Egypt and 
internationally (Baha El Din 1998), despite the paucity of published information 
on the status  of its fauna and flora in the literature. The coastal  areas  of the 
Suez Gulf seem to be an important area for both of reptiles and mammals, and 
also  birds;  It  is  considered  an  important  path  of  bird  migration  and  three 
important  bird  areas  are  located  in  this  area  (Ain  Sukhna,  El-Qaa  plain  and 
Gebel  El-Zeit)  (Baha  El  Din  1999,  2001;  Basuony  et  al.  2010),  with  no 
- 124 - 
Protected Areas on either sides. The area of Ain Sukhna and its periphery has 
been subjected  to  great  pressure in the  last  15  years:  the  high  levels  of  air 
pollution from tonnes of dust spewed out daily after the construction of a large 
cement factory has caused the death of desert vegetation within a radius of 15 
km  (Baha  El  Din  1999,  2001);  rapid  habitat  degradation  from  fast-growing 
tourism, overgrazing and quarrying; and unplanned new government projects 
such as the new shipping port, airport, large tourism-associated activities and 
projects and a heavy-industry zone. All these are thought to jeopardize wildlife 
(Baha El Din 1999, 2001) in the Ain Sukhna area. The El-Qaa  plain (on the 
eastern  side  of  Suez  Gulf)  is  important  for  the  conservation  of  the  Dorcas 
gazelle, as it represents a refuge for the largest remaining population in Sinai, 
and  is  also subject  to unplanned  coastal  tourism  development  (Baha  El Din 
1999,  2001).  The  conservation  importance  of  the  Suez  Gulf  coastal  areas 
should be considered before giving permissions to construct new industrial or 
tourism activities; otherwise the same fate of habitat destruction as happened 
on  the  Mediterranean  coast  will  occur  in  this  area.  The  Suez  Canal  area 
(especially  the  western  side)  shows  high  human  population  and  agricultural 
activity, which may militate against the construction of new Protected Areas in 
this  area.  The  eastern  side  of  the  Suez  Canal  seems  to  have  many  fewer 
sources of disturbance, which makes it potentially suitable for a new Protected 
Area after verification of the current status of its biodiversity. 
Gathering information from other studies discussing the effectiveness of 
Egyptâs Protected Areas network to cover important biodiversity hotspots can 
help to show  which areas require more  protection  across different taxonomic 
groups.  According  to  Gilbert  &amp;  Zalat  (2008)  and  Basuony  et  al.  (2010),  the 
network seems to be adequate to conserve Egyptian butterfly hotspots, except 
the  Mediterranean  coast  between  Alexandria  and  Sallum,  but  inadequate  to 
conserve  important  mammal  areas,  with  new  Protected  Areas  needed  to be 
constructed in the lower Nile Valley, along the north coast between Alexandria 
and Sallum,  top part  of the Suez Gulf,  and perhaps the Qattara Depression. 
The findings of Basuony et al. (2010) are consistent, to some extent, with the 
results  of  this  study,  with the need  to construct  new  Protected  Areas  at  the 
coasts of Suez Gulf, Mediterranean coast (from Mersa Matruh to Sallum) and 
the Qattara Depression.

Some  other  studies  have  used  Zonation  to  prioritize  areas  for 
conservation,  but  using  other  taxa.  Simaika  (2012)  suggested  that  the 
Protected  Area  network  in  Africa  is  not  enough  to  conserve  its  dragonflies, 
with  a  need  for  the  protection  of  an  additional  5%  of  the  area  of  Africa. 
Klorvuttimontara  (2010)  demonstrated  that  about  50%  of  areas  of  high 
prioritization value in Thailand are currently protected, and that will not change 
very  much  in  the  future.  He  predicted  that  the  conservation  value  of  the 
Protected  Areas  of  Thailand  to  conserve  butterflies  should  remain  similar  in 
the  future,  although increasing  the  quality  of  existing  Protected  Areas  would 
enhance the conservation status of the butterflies species in Thailand. Tognelli 
et al. (2011) showed that the Protected Area network of Argentina contain only 
a  limited  number  of  Xenarthran  mammals,  so  more  Protected  Areas  are 
needed  to  conserve  them.  However,  areas  of  high  prioritization  identified  by 
Zonation were not suitable for new Protected Areas because they are owned 
by  private  landowners  (Tognelli  et  al.  2011).  Simialrly  CorbalÃ¡n  et  al.  (2011) 
suggested  that  the  current  reserve  network  of  Argentinean  Patagonia  is  not 
enough to conserve its lizard species. 
de  Pous  et  al.  (2011)  used  the  ConsNet  Prioritization  algorithm  to 
assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  Conservation  Area  network  in  Morocco  to 
conserve the herpetofauna under the current climate. They demonstrated the 
need for  a major increase in the  network to guarantee  their conservation. In 
AraÃºjo et  al.âs  study  of  the  effectiveness  of  Protected  Areas  and  the  Natura 
2000  networks  to conserve  European  plant  and  terrestrial  vertebrates  under 
climate change, 58%  and 63%  of these species  were predicted to  be lost by 
2080  from  Protected  Areas  and  Natura  2000  areas,  respectively.  Birds  and 
mammals  were  predicted  to  have  a  higher proportion  of  losers  than winners 
inside  Protected  Areas  in  all  future  scenarios,  whilst  there  was  a  variable 
response  of  amphibians  and  an  increased  suitability for reptiles.  The  Natura 
2000 sites  were less  effective in conservation compared to Protected  Areas, 
although both were  predicted to perform better than  elsewhere, particularly if 
more conservation  efforts  were given  to biodiversity conservation specifically 
against  climate  change  (AraÃºjo  et  al.  2011).  Maiorano  et  al.  (2011) 
demonstrated that the current Protected Areas of the Mediterranean basin will 
strongly be affected by climate change, with highest predicted number of lost 
- 126 - 
species  (25-43%)  located  in  the  drier  Protected  Areas  of  North  Africa,  the 
Middle East  and Spain. Coetzee et al. (2009) showed that  the South African 
Important  Bird  Areas  are  expected  to  be  inadequate  to  conserve  endemic 
birds under climate change, with severe range changes predicted in the future. 
They suggest the need for new Important Bird Areas and Protected Areas to 
conserve the refugia of these species (Coetzee et al. 2009). 
 
The limitations of projecting into the future 
Using  species  distribution  models  for  extrapolations  is  risky  and  must  be 
treated  carefully  (Elith  et  al.  2010;  AraÃºjo  &amp;  Peterson  2012).  Possible 
uncertainties resulting from extrapolation beyond the limits of training data can 
be  assessed from the calculation of the  âMultivariate Environmental Similarity 
Surfacesâ (MESS),  available in recent  versions  of  Maxent  (Elith  et  al.  2010). 
MESS is  a measure of the similarity  of  any  given  pixel to a reference set  of 
pixels of chosen predictor variables; it is used to determine novel climates by 
giving  negative  values for  dissimilar pixels  where at least  one  variable  has  a 
value  outside  the  training  range  (Elith  et  al.  2010;  Elith  et  al.  2011).  Novel 
climates can then be used as a mask to inhibit the use of certain areas by the 
models,  or  as  a  measure  of  prediction  uncertainty  (Elith  et  al.  2010).  In  my 
study, MaxEnt  produced MESS maps  at  each possible combination of global 
circulation models, emission scenarios and time slices. The mean MESS value 
across  different  global  circulation  models  in  Egypt  is  shown  in  Fig.  47; 
depicting  which  areas  are  predicted  to  have  novel  climate  conditions  in  the 
future  at  each  possible  combination  of  emission  scenarios  and  time  slices. 
MESS output maps are continuous maps with values ranging from -100 (red) 
to  +100  (blue).  Positive  values  indicate  similar  future  climate  conditions 
compared to the current (the darker the blue, the higher is the similarity), while 
the  negative  values  indicate  locations  of  dissimilar  climate  compared  to  the 
current  (the  darker is  the  red,  the  higher  dissimilarity).  Under  both  emission 
scenarios at 2020 and 2050 and under the B2a scenario at 2080, areas with 
predicted  non-analogue climates  (i.e.  the  most  dissimilar novel  climates)  are 
located  at  east  of  El-Gilf  El-Kebir,  the  Red  Sea  coast  from  Mersa  Alam 
southwards, south  of Wadi  El-Allaqi near the Sudanese  borders, near Qena, 
- 127 - 
and over small patches on the Mediterranean coast and Suez Canal area. By 
2080  and under  A2a scenario,  larger  areas  are  predicted  to  be  subjected  to 
novel  climates,  with  much  higher  degree  of  dissimilarity  extending  to  a  high 
proportion of the Western Desert (including the oases), larger coastal areas on 
the  Red  Sea  (from  south  of  Hurghada  southwards),  eastern  and  northern 
Sinai, the Suez Canal area and around Cairo. The Protected Areas of Wadi El-
Gemal, Gebel Elba and Wadi El-Allaqi (and possibly Siwa, Taba and Zaranik) 
are  therefore  susceptible  to  potential  novel  climates  in  the  future.  Future 
projections  in  areas  of  high  future climate  dissimilarity should  be interpreted 
with caution. 
 
Conclusion 
My results suggest that about 10% of the Egyptian reptiles will suffer greatly in 
the  future  due  to  climate  change.  Eight  species  are  predicted  to  lose  up  to 
80%  of  their  suitable  habitats  in the  future.  The  current  network  of  Egyptian 
Protected Areas appears to be inadequate to conserve Egyptian reptiles; new 
Protected  Areas  are  probably  needed  at  Wadi  El-Natrun,  the  Qattara 
Depression, eastern side of Suez Canal, Gebel El-Gallal area, coastal areas of 
Aqaba  Gulf,  western  Mediterranean  coasts  between  Mersa  Matruh  and 
Sallum,  and  Gebel  El-Hallal  area  in  North  Sinai.  More  strict  protection  is 
required in the Protected Areas of St Katherine, Siwa oasis and Gebel Elba.

Testing the accuracy of species distribution models using species records from a new field survey&lt;br&gt;
Oikos, 119(8): 1326â1334&lt;br&gt;

Species distribution models are a very popular tool in ecology and biogeography and have great potential to help direct conservation efforts. Models are traditionally tested by using half the original species records to build the model and half to
evaluate it. However, this can lead to overly optimistic estimates of model accuracy, particularly when there are systematic biases in the data. It is better to evaluate models using independent data. This study used independent species records
from a new to survey to provide a more rigorous evaluation of distribution-model accuracy. Distribution models were built for reptile, amphibian, butterfly and mammal species. The accuracy of these models was evaluated using the traditional
approach of partitioning the original species records into model-building and model-evaluating datasets, and using independent records collected during a new field survey of 21 previously unvisited sites in diverse habitat types. We tested whether
variation in distribution-model accuracy among species could be explained by species detectability, range size, number of records used to build the models, and body size. Estimates of accuracy derived using the new species records correlated
positively with estimates generated using the traditional data-partitioning approach, but were on average 22% lower. Model accuracy was negatively related to range size and number of records used to build the models, and positively related to the
body size of butterflies. There was no clear relationship between species detectability and model accuracy. The field data generally validated the species distribution models. However, there was considerable variation in model accuracy among
species, some of which could be explained by the characteristics of species. &lt;br&gt;
Species distribution models have great potential as tools for conservation. They relate a set of records of the occurrence of a species to a set of variables describing relevant aspects of the environment in order to predict its distribution over
the whole of the study area in question (reviewed by Wintle et al. 2005). &lt;br&gt;
There is a vast amount of data on the distributions of species in museums, natural history collections and the literature (Graham et al. 2004). However, there are several limitations associated with data from these sources. First, records are
often accompanied by an imprecise description of the locality from which they were taken. This translates into poor locational accuracy when the record is georeferenced (i.e. when it is assigned geographical coordinates, Graham et al. 2004). The
effect of locational error in the species records on the accuracy of distributional models is generally low, but varies among different types of model (Graham et al. 2008). &lt;br&gt;
Second, museum data are often biased. Such bias could be: 1) spatial â towards areas to which it is easy for scientists to gain access, or towards areas that are biologically interesting; 2) temporal â towards time periods when collecting was more
frequent; or 3) taxonomic â towards species that are easy to detect or that are of more interest to the collectors (SoberÃ³n 1999, Hijmans et al. 2000, Reddy and DÃ¡valos 2003). &lt;br&gt;
The third major problem with data from museums and literature sources is that there are rarely data documenting places where the species is known not to exist (absence records) (Graham et al. 2004). There are modelling techniques designed to be
used with datasets that consist only of presence records, such as climate envelope approaches and techniques that model the presences with reference to the background environmental conditions (Wintle et al. 2005). However, several of the most
popular modelling approaches, such as generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs), can only be used with both presence and absence data. A commonly-used solution to this problem is to generate random âpseudo-absenceâ
data in grid cells without presence records (Ferrier and Watson 1997). One obvious problem with using pseudoâabsence data is that some absences are likely to be found in areas that are suitable for, and even inhabited by, the species (Graham et
al. 2004). Of course, recorded absence of species may also prove to be erroneous. Many species are very difficult to detect and it may take many visits to a site before species absence can be inferred with any degree of confidence (KÃ©ry 2002,
MacKenzie et al. 2002). Given accurate species records from a well-designed survey, models built with only presence records have been shown to perform as well as models built with both presences and absences (Wintle et al. 2005) and may present
the safest option when there is uncertainty over the reliability of absence data. &lt;br&gt;
Data from museums, collections and the literature are too valuable a source of data to ignore. However, given the potential biases and inaccuracies associated with them, it is particularly important to test the accuracy of model predictions. The
simplest way to test the accuracy of a species distribution model is to test its ability to predict correctly the data used to build it in the first place (Fielding and Bell 1997). This is effectively a measure of goodness-of-fit of the model. The
main drawback of this approach is that a model can fit the data used to build it very well without capturing the speciesâ real response to the environmental variables (a phenomenon known as overfitting), and this method of model evaluation tends
to lead to over-optimistic measures of model accuracy (Chatfield 1995). A better approach is to partition the data in some way, building the model with part of the dataset and evaluating it against the remainder (Fielding and Bell 1997). This is
the approach taken by most studies (Hernandez et al. 2008, Franklin et al. 2009). A problem with data-partitioning approaches is that if the same bias in the species data is present in all partitions, then the model may be biased and the estimate
of model accuracy inflated (Chatfield 1995). Ideally models should be evaluated using new, independent data on species occurrence (Chatfield 1995). With the wide availability of global positioning systems (GPS), records can be assigned
geographical coordinates on collection, eliminating the problem of locational errors. Bias should be reduced as much as possible, particularly bias in environmental space (Wintle et al. 2005). Few studies have used independent data to validate
models because collecting such data can be impractical, time-consuming and costly (Wintle et al. 2005, but see Loyn et al. 2001, Elith 2002, Ferrier et al. 2002, Elith et al. 2006, Williams et al. 2009). To the best of our knowledge only one
study, on Mexican birds (Feria and Peterson 2002), has used new, independent records to test the accuracy of distribution models based on museum data. Given the potential limitations with records from museums, it is particularly important that the
accuracy of models based on them are evaluated rigorously. We used independent records to test the accuracy of distribution models for a variety of species in three separate taxonomic groups. &lt;br&gt;
Even if one is confident of a lack of bias in the data, different kinds of species may be more or less suited to the model-building process. There have been attempts to assess differences among species in the accuracy of their distribution models
(Kadmon et al. 2003, Berg et al. 2004, Seoane et al. 2005, Hernandez et al. 2006, Newbold et al. 2009b). These studies have often found that species that are more narrowly distributed produce more accurate distribution models, possibly because
small-ranged species have better-defined habitat requirements and tend to inhabit a greater proportion of the suitable environment, or because in species with larger ranges, populations show local adaptation to the environment in different areas
(Stockwell and Peterson 2002, Brotons et al. 2004, Segurado and AraÃºjo 2004, Hernandez et al. 2006, Newbold et al. 2009b). On the other hand, effects of range size could be a statistical artefact associated with the use of pseudo-absence data
(Lobo et al. 2008). &lt;br&gt;
Species that are easier to detect are likely to have more complete occurrence data. This may result in more accurate distribution models for these species (Seoane et al. 2005). For example, PÃ¶yry et al. (2008) showed that the accuracy of
distribution models for butterflies was positively related to wingspan, possibly owing to differences in detectability during surveys. &lt;br&gt;
In this study, we modelled the distributions of Egyptian butterfly, mammal, reptile and amphibian species using records from museums, collections and the literature, presenting a rare test of their accuracy using new, independently-collected
survey data as well as a test using the more traditional data-partitioning method. It was not possible to collect new species records systematically or randomly in the time available because of the remoteness and inaccessibility of many parts of
Egypt, but the records were completely independent of the data used to build the models, were designed to be representative of as many habitat types as possible, given the constraints imposed by the logistics of sampling in a remote and hostile
environment, and were georeferenced using a GPS and so had negligible locational error. We used the new survey data, which contain both presence and absence records, to test whether a negative effect of species range size on model accuracy
persists in the absence of statistical artefacts. We also tested whether model accuracy is related to species detectability and body size (of butterflies). &lt;br&gt;
Data and methods &lt;br&gt;
Distribution models were compiled for Egyptian butterfly, mammal, reptile and amphibian species using Maxent ver. 3.1.0 (Phillips et al. 2006). Maxent uses a machine-learning process to produce a model where the frequency distribution of modelled
probabilities is as close to uniform as possible, with the constraint that the expected value of each environmental variable (the sum, across all grid cells, of the product of the probability of occurrence and the value of the environmental
variable) must equal the mean value at the presence points (the empirical average). To prevent overfitting a process called regularization is adopted, relaxing this constraint such that the expected value of each environmental variable may fall
within a defined margin around the empirical average (DudÃ­k et al. 2004). Maxent is particularly suited to use with museum data, because it designed to deal with datasets consisting only of presence records. The environmental conditions in a
sample of cells from throughout the whole study area is used for comparison with the environmental conditions in cells with species presence records in. &lt;br&gt;
The species data used to build the models (hereafter referred to as the original species records) were taken from the database complied as part of Egypt&#39;s BioMAP project ( www.biomapegypt.org for more details). Records were taken from museum and
personal collections, and from the literature (Osborn and Helmy 1980, Larsen 1990). The identification of all extant specimens was checked by experts (Samy Zalat, Sherif Baha-El-Din, Francis Gilbert, Dr Mohammad Basuony, Al Azhar Univ., Cairo),
according to the latest taxonomic opinion (Larsen 1990, Wilson and Reeder 2005, Baha El Din 2006). All records were mapped as accurately as possible using a gazetteer developed by the BioMAP project. We estimated the maximum error associated with
each sampling location using the point radius method (Wieczorek et al. 2004) and removed records from highly inaccurate localities. Given positive spatial autocorrelation in the environmental variables, a moderate degree of inaccuracy in the
location of species records probably does not have a large effect on model accuracy (Graham et al. 2008). The number of records available for each species ranged from 10 to 412 (median = 58); most records were made in the second half of the 20th
century (Newbold et al. 2009a). &lt;br&gt;
The environmental variables used in the models consisted of climate and habitat variables. The climate variables were taken from the WorldClim ver. 1.4 dataset (Hijmans et al. 2005). This dataset includes 20 variables describing altitude,
temperature and precipitation (Supplementary material Appendix 1). The habitat variable used was a geological habitat classification with 11 categories (sea, littoral coastal land, cultivated land, sand dune, wadi, metamorphic rock, igneous rock,
gravel, serir sand sheet, sabkha and sedimentary rock). This map was compiled using satellite imagery, and was verified by extensive ground-truthing (A. Hassan unpubl.). Using 20 environmental variables might cause the models to be overfitted
(Chatfield 1995). However, the Maxent model uses a process called regularization to reduce the chance of overfitting and previous studies have shown that it can produce accurate models with small numbers of species records and similar numbers of
environmental variables to our study (Wisz et al. 2008). To test whether this was the case in our study, we built a separate set of distribution models using habitat and three principal component axes based on the climatic variables. Models
developed using the two sets of variables were very similar (at 5000 random points in Egypt modelled probabilities of occurrence correlated positively â Spearman&#39;s rank correlation: mean rs= 0.798 Â± 0.02) and were not significantly different in
accuracy (Wilcoxon&#39;s matched-pairs test: p = 0.122). &lt;br&gt;
To create a second set of species data (hereafter referred to as the independent species records) with which to evaluate the distribution models, we conducted a survey of butterflies, mammals, reptiles and amphibians in Egypt in the summers
(MayâJuly) of 2007 and 2008. The reptile, amphibian and mammal species surveyed are active throughout the summer months. The flight periods of all of the butterfly species surveyed encompassed the whole period of sampling. The new records were not
used to build distribution models, only to evaluate them. The new data were biased towards roads. The terrain in Egypt makes it almost impossible to sample completely randomly, with many areas situated hundreds of kilometres from the nearest road.
We minimized bias in environmental space as much as possible by selecting sites that covered: (1) as large a geographical area as possible; and (2) as many different habitat types as possible, defined using a geological habitat map (A. Hassan
unpubl.) and a vegetation land cover map, derived using data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (Hansen et al. 2000). At each site we performed four 1-km walking transects at different times of day (early morning, late morning, late
afternoon, evening), paced to take approximately an hour and a half each. At the same time, some members of the expedition actively searched for species in the area surrounding the start point of the transect. Transects were located such that they
sampled all the major habitat types present at each site. A species was recorded as being present if it was observed at least once, and absent otherwise. Twenty-one sites were surveyed in this way (Fig. 1, Supplementary material Appendix 1). In
addition to records from the fully-surveyed sites, we also included incidental observations of species from 13 other localities (Fig. 1, Supplementary material Appendix 1). Data from these sites consisted of records of species presence only,
because we did not carry out replicate transects at these sites and thus could not infer species absence. Almost all new sites were situated at least 1 km from sites with records in the original dataset (Fig. 1). All fully-surveyed sites were at
least three km from the nearest other site, and all but four were at least ten km from the nearest other site. Including locations with incidental records, distances among sites were sometimes much smaller; four sites were less than one km from
the nearest other site and 15 sites were less than ten km from the nearest site. Butterflies were sampled by visual searching and sweep netting, reptiles and amphibians by visual scans and active searches, and mammals mainly by checking for tracks
and signs, although sightings of species were also noted. Sixty species were recorded in total, 34 of which were recorded at least twice: 20 reptiles and amphibians, ten butterflies and four mammals (Supplementary material Appendix 1). &lt;br&gt;
Sites with reptile, amphibian, butterfly and mammal records in the BioMAP database (grey crosses and asterisks), and sites that were sampled during the new survey (black triangles). &lt;br&gt;
Imperfect detectability of species is likely to have an impact on the reliability of data describing species absence from surveys such as ours (KÃ©ry 2002, MacKenzie et al. 2002). We modelled the detectability of species in our new survey data,
following MacKenzie et al. (2002). The four transects undertaken at each site were treated as independent visits (n1, n2, n3, and n4). The likelihood (L) of obtaining a particular pattern of occurrence for a species across all four transects at
all fully-surveyed sites is: &lt;br&gt;
where Ï is the probability that a species occurs at a given site, p is the probability that the species is detected during one transect given that it occurs at the site, t is the transect number, n. is the number of sites where the species was
recorded in at least one transect, and N is the total number of sites visited (MacKenzie et al. 2002). The parameters p and Ï were estimated using a maximum likelihood approach with the package âmleâ in R (R Development Core Team 2004). Upper and
lower bounds of 0.0001 and 0.9999 respectively were set for both parameters. The model has been shown to be reasonably robust to sample sizes as small as those encountered here (Wintle et al. 2004). The model assumes that occurrence and detection
probabilities are constant across sites, which is almost certainly not true. The modelled probabilities should therefore be considered rough estimates to gauge the reliability of the occurrence data and not as accurate estimates of the
probabilities of detection and occurrence. &lt;br&gt;
The distribution models were evaluated using three different sets of data. First, using partitioned data, whereby the original species records were divided randomly before modelling â half for model building and half for model evaluation. Models
were evaluated using these reserved presence records and 2500 pseudo-absences (Ferrier and Watson 1997), drawn randomly from cells that lacked a record of the species in question. Second, using the independent species presence records and 2500
pseudo-absences, generated as before. Third, using the independent presence and absence records. Model accuracy was measured using the AUC statistic (Fielding and Bell 1997). The receiver operating characteristic curve is a plot of the proportion
of presence records correctly predicted present (sensitivity) against the proportion of absence records incorrectly predicted present (commission) for a range of thresholds used to divide predicted presence from predicted absence. The area under
the curve (AUC) measures the ability of the model to discriminate recorded presences from recorded absences (Fielding and Bell 1997). An AUC value of 1 indicates perfect discrimination and an AUC value of 0.5 indicates a model that is no better
than random. Estimated accuracy according to AUC values was compared among the three approaches. We correlated estimates of accuracy made by partitioning the original species records with estimates made using the independent records, to test
whether models were ranked similarly. To provide an alternative measure of accuracy to the AUC statistic, the models were also tested against the independent presence and absence records using the slope of the relationship between model predicted
probability and species occurrence (presence or absence), fitted using a generalized linear model with binomial errors (McCullagh and Nelder 1989). &lt;br&gt;
We tested a number of factors that may explain variation in model accuracy (measured using the independent presence and absence records) among species: (1) estimated species detectability (2) range size in Egypt; (3) number of presence records
used to build the models; and (4) taxonomic group (mammals, butterflies, or reptiles and amphibians). The proportion of Egypt&#39;s land area predicted by the distribution models to be occupied was used as an index of range size. To calculate this, we
converted the continuous prediction of probability of occurrence into a binary prediction of presence or absence, by assigning a threshold probability of occurrence to the model for each species. The threshold was set such that 95% of the presence
records used to build the models were predicted correctly as being present (Pearson et al. 2004). &lt;br&gt;
The effect of estimated species detectability on distribution-model accuracy was tested by a simple correlation test, because detectability could not be estimated for species that were not recorded during the walking transects. As an additional
test of the effect of estimated species detectability, we also correlated butterfly wingspans (wing-tip to wing-tip; Gilbert and Zalat 2007) with model accuracy. The remaining factors were tested using generalized linear models with normal errors.
AUC values were entered as the dependent variable, taxonomic group as a factor, and predicted range size and number of presence records used to build the model as covariates. We used a model selection method based on the approach recommended by
Burnham and Anderson (2002). We built a global model with all terms, and candidate models with every combination of terms. AIC scores were extracted for each model and the difference between a model&#39;s AIC value and the lowest value of all models
(the AIC difference, Îi) was calculated. Model weight was calculated using the following formula (Burnham and Anderson 2002):&lt;br&gt;
where Îi is the AIC difference of the model in question and Îrs are the AIC differences of the other models. The relative importance of each variable was assessed by summing the AIC weights of all candidate models containing it (Burnham and
Anderson 2002), hereafter referred to as âsum of AIC weightsâ. &lt;br&gt;
Results &lt;br&gt;
Estimates of the probability of detecting a species in a single transect (p) ranged from less than 0.001 to approximately 0.75 (Table 1). For butterflies, the migratory species Vanessa atalanta and Vanessa cardui, and the skipper Pelopidas thrax
had low probabilities of detection, but most species were relatively easily detected. Mammals generally had much lower probabilities of detection than butterflies; the gazelle Gazella dorcas was an exception because its presence could be reliably
ascertained by tracks and faeces. Reptiles and amphibians were highly variable in their estimated detectability. The snakes and the chamaeleon Chamaeleo africanus had very low probabilities of detection, while the lizards, skinks and amphibians
generally had higher probabilities. Estimates of the probability of site occupancy (Ï), which is equivalent to the proportion of sites predicted to be occupied, were consistent with estimates of range size derived from the species distribution
models (Spearman&#39;s rank correlation test: rs= 0.453, n = 23, p = 0.03). &lt;br&gt;
Table 1. Estimated probabilities of occurrence (Ï) and detection, given occurrence (p) for species recorded in the walking transects at the fully-surveyed sites. Each transect was treated as an independent sampling event. Ï and p were estimated

Model accuracy estimates made by partitioning the original species records into model-building and model-evaluation datasets, were high and significantly better than random (one sample t-test: t = 22.0, DF = 33, p 0.001). AUC values ranged from
0.666 to 0.975, with an average of 0.845 Â± 0.016. Accuracy estimates made using the independent presence records (i.e. records from the new survey) and pseudo-absences were also high and significantly better than random (t = 16.7, DF = 33, p
0.001). AUC values ranged from 0.485 to 1.000, with an average of 0.875 Â± 0.022. Finally, accuracy estimates generated using the independent presences and absences were reasonably high and significantly better than random (t = 4.03, DF= 33, p
0.001), although lower than estimates made using pseudo-absences. AUC values ranged from 0.219 to 1.000, with an average of 0.655 Â± 0.039 (for examples of the distribution models, Fig. 2). Testing the accuracy of models against the independent
records, using the slope of the relationship between model predicted probability of occurrence and observed occurrence (presence or absence), also showed the predictions to be reasonably accurate. The relationships were positive for 26/34 species,
although only nine were significantly positive (GLM: p 0.05). Slope coefficients ranged from â5.67 to 22.13; the average coefficient was significantly greater than zero (one sample t-test: t = 3.16, DF = 32, p = 0.003). Estimates of accuracy made
using subsets of the original presence records correlated significantly and positively with estimates made using the independent records (Spearman&#39;s rank correlation: rs= 0.544, n = 34, p = 0.001; Fig. 3). &lt;br&gt;
Predicted distributions and independent occurrence records for two species: (a) the Montpellier snake Malpolon monspessulanus, which had the most accurate distribution model; and (b) the cape hare Lepus capensis, which had the least accurate
distribution model. Distribution models were built with Maxent ver. 3.1.0 using records from the BioMAP database and variables describing climate and habitat. Light shading indicates areas with a high probability of occurrence, while dark shading
indicates a low probability of occurrence. The independent occurrence records (+= presence; O = absence) were collected during a new field survey of 21 sites in the summers (MayâJuly) of 2007 and 2008; these records were used to evaluate the
distribution models. &lt;br&gt;
The relationship, for 34 species of Egyptian mammal, butterfly, reptile and amphibian species, between distribution-model accuracy estimated using independent species presence and absence records, and distribution-model accuracy estimated using
partitioned data, whereby the original species presence records were randomly divided in half for model building and model evaluation respectively. Accuracy was estimated using the AUC statistic (Fielding and Bell 1997). &lt;br&gt;
Model accuracy showed no clear relationship with estimated species detectability (Spearman&#39;s rank correlation: rs=â0.294, n = 25, p = 0.154). However, for butterfly species, wingspan correlated positively with model accuracy (Pearson s correlation
coefficient: r = 0.652 n = 10, p = 0.041; Fig. 4). Model accuracy was negatively related to the predicted range size of species within Egypt (GLM: sum of AIC weights = 0.952; Table 2, Fig. 5a). Surprisingly, there was also a strong negative effect
of the number of species presence records used to build the models on the accuracy of predictions (sum of AIC weights = 0.991; Table 2, Fig. 5b). There was little support for an effect of taxonomic group on the accuracy of distribution models (sum
of AIC weights = 0.172; Table 2). &lt;br&gt;
Table 2. Results from a set of generalized linear models with a normal error distribution testing factors affecting variation in the accuracy of species distribution models among species. Factors tested were predicted range size in Egypt (R),
number of presence records used to build the models (S), and taxonomic group (T). Candidate models were built with every combination of terms. These models were compared using AIC and the difference between the AIC of a model and the minimum AIC
of all models. Model weights were calculated following Burnham and Anderson (2002). &lt;br&gt;
For 34 species of Egyptian reptiles, amphibians, butter-flies and mammals: (a) the relationship between range size, estimated as the proportion of grid cells in Egypt predicted occupied, and the accuracy of distribution models estimated using
independent species records from a new field survey; (b) the relationship between the number of presence records used to build the distribution model and model accuracy, estimated using independent species records. Model accuracy was measured
using the AUC statistic (Fielding and Bell 1997). &lt;br&gt;
Discussion &lt;br&gt;
Overall, the distribution models built in this study were shown to be significantly better than random when tested against independent data collected by surveying a diverse range of habitats in Egypt. This strongly suggests that data from museums,
natural history collections and literature can be used to make useful predictions about speciesâ ranges. Several studies have reached a similar conclusion (Peterson et al. 2002, Raxworthy et al. 2003), but it is rare that models are tested against
independent evaluation data (but see Loyn et al. 2001, Elith 2002, Ferrier et al. 2002, Elith et al. 2006). Uncertainties and biases will be more prevalent in models built using museum and literature records (Graham et al. 2004), making evaluation
with independent data more important. Some authors have experimented with using species records from separate geographical areas (Peterson and Shaw 2003, Randin et al. 2006, Heikkinen et al. 2007) or time periods (Raxworthy et al. 2003) to
evaluate models. However, predictions extrapolated outside the environmental conditions encompassed by the data that were used to build the model are likely to be inaccurate in the new areas even if they are accurate in the area for which they
were built. The best approach is to collect new, independent data inside the study area for which the models were developed reducing bias as much as possible, particularly bias in environmental space (Wintle et al. 2005). &lt;br&gt;
The reliability of data on species absence probably depends on the relative detectability of the taxa in question (MacKenzie et al. 2002). There was substantial variation in estimated detection probability among species in the new survey. The
results of the maximum likelihood model were consistent with our expectations. First, the predicted proportion of sites occupied correlated positively with predicted range size according to the distribution models. Second, detection probabilities
were very low for elusive species, such as the snakes, and for rare migrants, such as the red admiral butterfly Vanessa atalanta, and higher for conspicuous and more abundant species, including some of the lizards and most of the butterflies. The
accuracy of species distribution models did not appear to be affected by detection probability suggesting that, even in small-scale surveys with relatively few visits to each site, imperfect detection of species may not be a major problem. On the
other hand, the accuracy of distribution models for butterfly species was positively correlated with body size, which was used as a surrogate for detectability. It is possible that our maximum likelihood-based estimates of detection probability
were inaccurate; for instance, one of the major assumptions of the maximum likelihood model that we used is that occurrence and detection probabilities are constant across sites (MacKenzie et al. 2002), which is very unlikely to be true. However,
very abundant and easily detectable species, such as the long-tailed blue butterfly Lampides boeticus and Bosk&#39;s lizard Acanthodactylus boskianus, had high estimated detection probabilities and inaccurate distribution models, whereas species that
are difficult to detect, such as Montpellier&#39;s snake Malpolon monspessulanus, had low estimated detectability but very accurate distribution models. An alternative explanation for the relationship between butterfly wingspan and distribution-model
accuracy is that larger butterflies are more mobile and able to reach a greater proportion of suitable habitat, giving a closer correlation between environmental variables and occurrence (PÃ¶yry et al. 2008), although the effect of body size on
butterfly mobility is contentious (Cowley et al. 2001). &lt;br&gt;
Estimates of model accuracy made using the data partitioning approach were relatively consistent with estimates made using the new survey data. This suggests that a data-partitioning approach can give us a good idea about the relative accuracy of
models and can be used to compare model accuracy among species. Accuracy estimates made using the partitioned species records and pseudo-absences, and also with independent presence records and pseudo-absences, were much higher than estimates made
using both independent presence and independent absence records. This is consistent with a previous suggestion that overly-optimistic estimates of model accuracy can be generated using pseudo-absence data (Lobo et al. 2008), but it should be borne
in mind that the small numbers of independent records may partly explain the low measures of accuracy using independent data. Nevertheless, further comparisons of model accuracy using pseudo-absences and real absences are needed and it would be
prudent not to use data partitioning as the sole method for evaluating distribution models, especially if the models will be used for conservation decision-making. The accepted threshold of 0.7 above which models are considered to be good (Pearce
and Ferrier 2000) may place undeserved confidence in poor predictions. &lt;br&gt;
Some of the variation in model accuracy was explained by range size. Species with larger ranges within Egypt were modelled less accurately than species with smaller ranges. A negative effect of range size on the accuracy of species distribution
models has been reported before (Stockwell and Peterson 2002, Brotons et al. 2004, Segurado and AraÃºjo 2004, Hernandez et al. 2006, Newbold et al. 2009b), but most of these studies have used real presence data with pseudo-absence data. Thus, the
apparent effect of range size could be a statistical artefact owing to pseudo-absences being more distant in environmental space from the presence records for species with smaller range sizes (Lobo et al. 2008). Our results show that the
distributions of species with smaller ranges are modelled more accurately even in the absence of statistical artefacts. This could be because narrowly-distributed species have more specific climate and habitat requirements than more widespread
species (Brotons et al. 2004, Hernandez et al. 2006). Alternatively, separate populations of widespread species may show local adaptation to the environmental conditions in different parts of the study area (Stockwell and Peterson 2002, Brotons et
al. 2004): although two of the butterfly species have more than one sub-species in Egypt (Carcharodus stauderi and Spialia doris; Gilbert and Zalat 2007), these distinctions were not considered in this study. &lt;br&gt;
Surprisingly, we found a significant negative effect of the number of species records used to build models on the accuracy of model predictions. Most previous studies have found the relationship between sample size and model accuracy, if present,
to be positive (Pearce and Ferrier 2000, Phillips et al. 2004). Several studies have shown that species with narrower distributions and more specific habitat requirements are modelled more accurately (Kadmon et al. 2003, Hernandez et al. 2006,
Newbold et al. 2009b). It is probable that some aspect of this was captured by sample size but not by the measure of range size that we used. For example, more narrowly distributed species are likely to be less abundant (Gaston et al. 2000) and
thus detected less often during surveys. Alternatively, habitat specialists may be easier to model because they have very specific requirements, but may be restricted to particular microhabitats or resources and thus have been detected less
frequently in the past. &lt;br&gt;
Ideally data used to evaluate the accuracy of distribution models should be completely independent of the data used to build the models and free from any bias (Chatfield 1995), but given limited resources this may not be possible (Wintle et al.
2005). Although our new species records contained some bias (for example, towards locations near roads), we reduced environmental bias by selecting sites that covered as broad a range of climate and habitat types as possible. This approach is
better than simple data-partitioning, because some bias has been eliminated and because locational error in the records has been eliminated. Moreover, it is more practicable than a truly random survey, especially for less accessible areas such as
Egypt. The time constraints imposed on our field expedition meant that we were only able to survey the northeast part of Egypt. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the models were accurate for other parts of Egypt, particularly in the Western
desert where museum records are scarce. Nevertheless, at least in northeast Egypt, the models appeared to provide an accurate reflection of the distribution of species. &lt;br&gt;
In conclusion, our results support the use of species distribution models in ecology. Predictions made for many species in three very different taxonomic groups were shown to be accurate using completely independent species occurrence data.
However, there was considerable variation across species in the accuracy of distribution models. Distribution models have great potential as tools for conservation, but it is crucial that their predictions are first evaluated thoroughly.
Currently, using completely independent data to evaluate model predictions is a rare practice, which is not surprising given that conducting new surveys can be time-consuming and very expensive (Wintle et al. 2005). However, we show that even
small field surveys can be used to test model accuracy and can highlight patterns in the accuracy of models. &lt;br&gt;

Biodiversity economics: the value of pollination services to Egypt&lt;br&gt;
Egyptian Journal of Biology, 11, 45-51&lt;br&gt;
Abstrac: Pollinator populations are under severe pressure worldwide because of man-made intensification in land use, including the use of pesticides and fertilizers. The majority of wild and crop plants are fully or partially dependent on
pollinators for their reproduction. Loss of pollinators has already caused measurable declines in the populations of many wild plants in Europe. Many Egyptian crops are fully or partially dependent on pollinators for their yields, and data exist
on the market values of Egyptian crops. We therefore use these to estimate the 2004 costs to the Egyptian economy of a catastrophic loss of pollinators. The annual cost to the Egyptian economy of losing its pollinators would be approximately LE
13.5 billion ($2.4
billion), 3.3% of the 2003 GDP. &lt;br&gt;
Introduction: Our lives are heavily dependent upon the planet&#39;s biodiversity and the ecological systems that it supports. The many products (e.g. raw materials such as timber) and services (e.g. climate regulation) provided by these ecosystems are
not only essential to our own survival but also to the functioning of the Earth&#39;s life-support system (Millenium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). &lt;br&gt;
Due to the difficulty of placing a realistic monetary worth on ecosystems, their services are not given adequate importance when making policy decisions (van Jaarsveld et al. 2005). Agriculture in particular has many obvious dependencies on
natural services provided by the ecosystem. Ironically, however, agriculture is one of the main driving forces behind the decline of biodiversity (UNEP 2007). &lt;br&gt;
Pollination is a prime example of a supporting service that is being negatively affectedby agricultural practices, as well as by other factors such as global warming and urbanisation (Klein et al. 2007). Pollination is essential to most plants for
reproduction, including commercial crops. This ecosystem function is provided by many wild pollinator species. There have been worldwide declines in pollinator diversity (Dias et al. 1999, Klein et al. 2007), with declines identified in at least
one region or country on every continent (except Antarctica), including the UK and Netherlands in Europe (Biesmeijer et al. 2006). &lt;br&gt;
The types of pollinators in decline include wild bees (social and solitary), domesticated honeybees, hoverflies, butterflies, bats, hummingbirds and other small mammals. The causes of these declines in pollinator biodiversity are almost certainly
related to changes in landuse (Klein et al. 2007). &lt;br&gt;
Pollinators require local floral diversity and nesting sites in order to persist in the unnatural environment of farmed land, but loss of natural habitat (usually related to land use practices) prevents this. Agricultural intensification leads to
loss and fragmentation of natural pollinator habitat, while climate change, introduction of alien plants and competition with non-native fauna adds to the pressure placed on pollinator populations. &lt;br&gt;
Without the service provided by pollinators, many plant species would be driven to extinction, and cultivation of many modern crops would be impossible. Many crops are wholly dependent on cross-pollination (such as melons and squash) by
pollinators, while other crops show significant yield increases when cross-pollinated instead of self-pollinated (such as Brading et al.: apples, tomatoes and cotton). It has been estimated that pollination is responsible for as much as 30% of
agricultural food production (UNEP 2007), and in some cases pollination services may contribute as much or more to yields than fertilisers. Due to its ability to dramatically improve yields, the economic value of natural pollination worldwide is
thought to be between US$65 and US$70 billion each year (Dias et al. 1999). Inadequate pollination can not only reduce yields, but may also delay them and be the reason for inferior fruit production. &lt;br&gt;
Domesticated honeybees remain the worldâs most important pollinators (Klein et al. 2007), but even they are declining and disappearing for no obvious reason (BBC 2007). Without wild pollinator species, current levels of agricultural productivity
are under threat. &lt;br&gt;
The International Pollinators Initiative (Dias et al. 1999) was adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity because of the perceived threat to such a valuable ecosystem service. However, action by politicians and decision-makers is hampered
by a lack of estimates of the true value of this ecosystem service. Several methods have been proposed that try to give a monetary value to ecosystem services, none of them perfect (de Groot et al. 2002, Chee 2004). Direct market valuation is the
exchange value that services have in trade. &lt;br&gt;
While straightforward, the value is only what the product is worth to a buyer, and omits other less direct values of the services (de Groot et al. 2002). However, it is simple to understand and clear to apply, especially for pollination where the
value of the product is often available. &lt;br&gt;
Stimulated by a recent review on experimental evaluations of the impact of pollination on crops (Klein et al. 2007), we use here the Direct Market Valuation approach to estimate the economic value of pollination to the Egyptian economy. &lt;br&gt;
Materials &amp; Methods &lt;br&gt;
Egyptâs main arable output covers 70 different plants, including non-consumed field crops (such a cotton), fruits, nuts and vegetables. These plants differ in their reliance on pollinators for successful fruit and seed setting, from full
dependence (e.g. watermelon, melon, custard apples) to total independence (e.g. date, grape, maize, olive). The review by Klein et al. (2007) places the available information for each crop into one of four categories of the impact of pollinator
loss on yield: essential (reduction of &gt;90%), high (40-90% loss), modest (10-40%), little (0-10%) and none (0%). For calculation, we used the midpoint of these ranges: 95, 65, 25, 5 and 0 respectively. Although these are approximations, when
summed over all the types of Egyptian crops, the final figure is likely to be a reasonable estimate. &lt;br&gt;
Klein et al. (2007) was based on a worldwide review rather than an Egyptian-specific one, and it would be very useful to have an equivalent review of Egyptian pollination studies: &lt;br&gt;
alas, such a review does not exist. The estimated reductions represent the average loss in yield obtained in all the various experiments carried out on any one crop type anywhere in the world. &lt;br&gt;
The figures might well be different under Egyptian conditions, but until the relevant experiments and review have been done, we do not know. The overall message is, however, unlikely to be very different with Egypt-specific values for the impact
of pollinator loss. &lt;br&gt;
The total values of each of the Egyptian crops was obtained from the publication by the Economic Affairs Sector (2006) of the Ministry of Agriculture. This gives values either overall, or split by season or by land type (old or newly developed
areas): we used the overall values. &lt;br&gt;
The use of each crop, and therefore the impact of pollinator loss, varies. Thus some crops produce vegetative growth that is consumed: pollinators affect seed production for the next generation in those crops that are grown from seed each year.
For crops that are grown vegetatively, the impact of pollinators is more long-term, but no less serious. For example, a standard fodder crop in Egypt is barseem (i.e. alfalfa), which can be cropped for six yearsbefore needing to be renewed from
seed. However, alfalfa is well-known for its seed production being dependent on wild-bee pollinators because honeybees are especially poor: Brading et al.: semi-domesticated solitary bees (Megachile rotundata), on the other hand, do the job very
well. Here we simply multiplied the value of the crop by the proportion of the yield that would be lost if pollinators were absent. Over the long term, we regard this as justifiable. &lt;br&gt;
Results &lt;br&gt;
The results (Table 1) are dominated (46%) by the impact of pollinator loss on alfalfa, predicted to cause annual losses of more than LE 6 billion (more than US $ 1 billion). It is true that even if seed production were reduced, this might not
affect the production of the fodder itself. &lt;br&gt;
However, in the long term, there would be a substantial impact. For valuable crops, such asmelons, pollinator loss would also have a huge economic impact, an annual loss of almost LE 1.9 billion (US $ 333 million). &lt;br&gt;
Overall, according to these calculations, almost LE 13.5 billion (US $ 2.4 billion) would be lost every year. Since Egyptâs GDP in 2003 was LE 411 billion (UNESCO 2007), this represents about 3.3% of GDP. &lt;br&gt;
Table 1: Monetary losses based on the average yield reduction that would be the consequence of loss of pollinators in Egypt for the crop production of 2004. There are approximately 5.7 LE to each $US. Pollination losses are taken from Klein et al
(2007); crop values from Economic Affairs Sector (2006). &lt;br&gt;

Discussion &lt;br&gt;
Biological services, while essential for the whole planetâs survival and persistence, are often overlooked in a countryâs economics. Without many of these services, invisibly working in the background, many economies would collapse. An early
estimate for the value of pollination services was 0.4% of GDP for the whole world (Costanza et al. 1997); in managed pollination, a single solitary bee (Habropoda) can be worth $20 to Vaccinium pollination (Kevan &amp; Phillips 2001), and the
pollination services provided by nearby forest reserves for coffee plantations amounted to 7% of farm income (Ricketts et al. 2004). For comparison in the way in which we have calculated pollination services here, the value of insect ecosystem
services to the USA was estimated by Losey &amp; Vaughan (2006) at $58 billion (made up of dung burial 0.4, pollination 3.1, pest control of native herbivores 4.5, and ârecreationâ [food for game, fish and wildlife] 50.0). Since the GDP of the USA in
2006 was $13 trillion, this represents only 0.45% of GDP, with pollination services accounting for only 0.02%. &lt;br&gt;
In developing countries, pollinator services are almost certainly more significant in that a greater proportion of the human population is maintained by income provided by agriculture: Egypt is no exception. Crops that are fully dependent on
pollinators, such as melons (including watermelons), onions and aubergines (eggplants), are some of the biggest contributors to the Egyptian agricultural market. With declining populations of pollinators, these crops will suffer a dramatic drop in
production, and this will have a huge impact not only on the individual producers, but on the whole of Egyptâs economy. &lt;br&gt;
The Nile Valley represents an environment with one of the worldâs longest records of continuously habitation by man. Virtually all natural habitats have disappeared, and many insects must have been already lost before the advent of modern
agriculture. 21st-century declines of pollinators on an already-narrowed group of pollinators are likely to be serious. &lt;br&gt;
Egypt needs to implement strategies to prevent and reverse declines in pollinator populations. &lt;br&gt;
Changing farming techniques (i.e. reducing intensification, conserving pollinator-friendly areas), and enforcing restrictions on pesticide use would go a long way to achieving this. While this sounds an expensive and counter-productive strategy,
the potential consequences of not implementing such a change could be far more costly to Egyptâs development. &lt;br&gt;

Climate-based models of spatial patterns of species richness in Egyptâs butterfly and mammal fauna&lt;br&gt;

Abstract &lt;br&gt; Aim: Identifying areas of high species richness is an important goal of conservation biogeography. In this study we compared alternative methods for generating climate-based estimates of spatial patterns of butterfly and mammal
species richness. &lt;br&gt; Location: Egypt. &lt;br&gt; Methods: Data on the occurrence of butterflies and mammals in Egypt were taken from an electronic database compiled from museum records and the literature. Using Maxent, species distribution models were
built with these data and with variables describing climate and habitat. Species richness predictions were made by summing distribution models for individual species and by modelling observed species richness directly using the same environmental
variables. &lt;br&gt; Results: Estimates of species richness from both methods correlated positively with each other and with observed species richness. Protected areas had higher species richness (both predicted and actual) than unprotected areas. &lt;br&gt;
Main conclusions: Our results suggest that climate-based models of species richness could provide a rapid method for selecting potential areas for protection and thus have important implications for biodiversity conservation. &lt;br&gt;
Introduction &lt;br&gt; In 2002, the Convention on Biological Diversity adopted the target of significantly reducing the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010. Monitoring biodiversity trends requires knowledge of the distributions of species and of patterns
in species richness. However, such data are limited, especially in the tropics (Anderson et al., 2003) and in arid regions (Stockwell &amp;amp; Peters, 1999). &lt;br&gt;
Using statistical methods to predict the distribution of species is an approach that shows great promise (Wintle et al., 2005). Distribution models relate known species occurrence data to environmental variables, such as climatic variables and
habitat types. Both traditional statistical techniques and newer methods have been shown to model individual species distributions with a high degree of accuracy (Elith et al., 2006). Some authors have experimented with summing individual
predictions of species distributions to estimate species richness. For example, Garcia (2006) produced distribution models for 267 reptile and amphibian species in Mexico and summed them to produce a prediction of species richness. However, when
large numbers of species are involved, summing distribution models to generate species richness predictions may be time-consuming (Gioia &amp;amp; Pigott, 2000). An alternative approach is to model species richness directly. Whilst there have been many
attempts to find climatic and habitat-related determinants of species richness patterns (e.g. Kivinen et al., 2007; Levinsky et al., 2007), no studies have explicitly compared summed distribution predictions with models of species richness per se,
although Gioia &amp;amp; Pigott (2000) used both approaches. Such a comparison will be very useful for conservation biologists attempting to understand spatial patterns of biodiversity. &lt;br&gt;
Many studies have investigated correlates of species richness, often finding climate variables to be good correlates of observed patterns (e.g. Hawkins et al., 2003). Arid environments are under-studied in this respect (but see van Rensburg et
al., 2002; Schmidt et al., 2008). The mechanistic explanation for these relationships remains a matter of debate, and the conclusions of any study of patterns of species richness are strongly affected by the spatial scale at which they are
conducted (Field et al., 2009). Currie et al. (2004) explored three hypotheses for climate-based patterns in species richness, concerning energy, the climatic tolerance of species and speciation rates. They did not find unequivocal support for any
of these hypotheses in the literature. At broad scales, historical factors (Qian &amp;amp; Ricklefs, 2000) and the distribution of resources (AraÃºjo &amp;amp; Luoto, 2007) may play important roles in determining species richness. At finer scales, competition
(Anderson et al., 2002), metapopulation dynamics (Hanski, 1991) and human disturbance (Uehara-Prado et al., 2007) have also been shown to exert a significant influence on species richness. &lt;br&gt;
Several studies have shown that butterfly and mammal species richness correlate with climate and habitat variables in temperate and tropical regions, at both local scales (Turner et al., 1987; Kivinen et al., 2007; Kuussaari et al., 2007) and at
broader scales (NoguÃ©s-Bravo &amp;amp; AraÃºjo, 2006; Algar et al., 2007; Levinsky et al., 2007). However, to date very few studies have investigated correlates of mammal and butterfly species richness in an arid environment (but for mammals see Andrews &amp;amp;
OâBrien, 2000). &lt;br&gt;
In this paper we report the results of a study of butterfly and mammal species richness in Egypt, a country with a typical arid-environment flora and fauna. Egypt has two endemic and two near-endemic butterfly species, and also three endemic
subspecies (Larsen, 1990). The mammal fauna includes four endemic and 10 near-endemic species. We sought to identify environmental correlates of species richness at a local scale in an arid environment. We also asked whether estimates of the
species richness of Egyptian butterflies and mammals derived from models of species richness had a good match with estimates made by summing individual models of the distribution of species, and whether both these estimates matched observed
patterns of species richness. &lt;br&gt;
One application of models of species richness is in assessing the effectiveness of protected areas. Global estimates of the effectiveness of protected areas generally suggest poor coverage of biodiversity (Chape et al., 2005). Country-level
studies have often found species richness to be no higher in protected areas than in unprotected areas (e.g. Pawar et al., 2007; Traba et al., 2007; but see, e.g., Lee et al., 2007). Egypt has 27 current or proposed protected areas, covering a
total of 11% of its land surface (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, 2007). All these have been gazetted since 1983, mostly at the recommendation of scientists familiar with Egyptâs biodiversity. As such, we may expect them to show better
coverage of biodiversity than protected areas in other countries. We tested whether protected areas in Egypt have higher species richness than unprotected areas. &lt;br&gt;
Materials and methods &lt;br&gt;
Species and climate data &lt;br&gt;
Species occurrence data were compiled as part of Egyptâs BioMAP project (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biomapegypt.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.biomapegypt.org/&lt;/a&gt; for more details). The butterfly dataset consisted of 1898 records for 59 species, mostly from museum specimens and the sparse literature on
Egyptian butterflies (Larsen, 1990; Gilbert &amp;amp; Zalat, 2007). Records were made between the years 1829 and 2006, but most were from the 20th century (see Fig. S1 in Appendix S1 in Supporting Information). All extant specimens in Egyptian collections
were re-identified according to the latest taxonomic opinion; Larsen (1990) had already reviewed and checked most other records. Coverage of Egypt is patchy, but probably fairly representative in the sense that all the main areas where butterflies
occur have been sampled, whilst the huge areas of the Great Sand Sea where no butterflies are thought to occur have not been sampled. The main lacuna in collecting effort is the Qattara Depression in the northern part of the Western Desert. &lt;br&gt;
The mammal data consisted of 4718 records for 103 species, also taken from museum and personal records, unpublished reports and the published literature. Mammal records were made between the years 1580 and 2007, but the majority fell in the second
half of the 20th century (see Fig. S1 in Appendix S1). The identification of every record and Egyptian specimen was checked or rechecked, according to the latest taxonomic opinion (Wilson &amp;amp; Reeder, 2005), by the top mammal taxonomist in Egypt (Dr
M. Bassiouny, Al Azhar University, Cairo). Coverage of Egypt is very good, due to systematic and extensive collecting in the period 1950â80 coupled with careful evaluation of taxonomy (see Osborn &amp;amp; Helmy, 1980). &lt;br&gt;
All locations were mapped as accurately as possible using a bespoke gazetteer developed by the BioMAP project over 3 years of collating Egyptian biodiversity records. The maximum error of each location was estimated by the point radius method (see
Wieczorek et al., 2004) and excessively inaccurate records rejected. &lt;br&gt;
Climatic predictors were taken from the WorldClim version 1.4 dataset at a resolution of 30 arcsec (c. 1 km) (Hijmans et al., 2005). This source contains 20 variables describing aspects of temperature, precipitation and elevation. We also used a
new Egyptian geological habitat map (hereafter referred to simply as habitat) (A. A. Hassan, unpublished data). Habitat was classified into 11 classes (sea, littoral coastal land, cultivated land, sand dune, wadi, metamorphic rock, igneous rock,
gravels, serir sand sheets, sabkhas and sedimentary rocks) based on remote sensing and extensive ground truthing. In preliminary analyses we also experimented with topographical predictors (slope and aspect). However, these variables did not
significantly improve model accuracy and were excluded from the final analyses. &lt;br&gt;
To ensure that the species records were not environmentally biased, we tested their coverage of the main environmental gradients. Butterfly and mammal sites were treated separately for this analysis. Four principal component variables based on the
20 climatic and elevation variables were each classified into four categories using Jenks (1967) natural breaks, giving 256 unique combinations of categories (henceforth called areas of climatic space). The number of areas of climatic space that
contained at least one survey location was calculated. To estimate the number of areas that would have been visited if sampling was completely random, we generated 100 sets of random survey points of the same number as the real sampling locations
and calculated the number of areas represented. To evaluate the coverage of habitat classes by sampled locations, a chi-square test was performed to assess whether sites fell into significantly (Î± = 0.05) different proportions of classes than
expected by chance. &lt;br&gt;
Modelling species richness &lt;br&gt;
We modelled the species richness of butterflies and mammals separately, using two methods. First, we summed predictions of the distribution of individual species, using a resolution of 30 arcsec. We made initial distribution models for the 40
butterfly species and 68 mammal species with at least eight records of occurrence, using Maxent version 2.3 (Phillips et al., 2006). Maxent is designed for use with species datasets that contain only records of presence (Phillips et al., 2006) and
thus may be particularly useful when species data are taken from museum collections. Maxent attempts to find a probability distribution that is as close to uniform as possible with the constraint that the expected value of each environmental
variable (the sum, across all grid cells, of the product of the probability of occurrence and the value of the environmental variable) must equal the mean value at the presence points (the empirical average). Regularization relaxes this constraint
such that the expected value of each environmental variable may fall within a predefined margin around the empirical average, preventing over-fitting of the model (DudÃ­k et al., 2004). The algorithm runs until improvement in model accuracy at each
iteration falls below a set threshold (convergence) or until a maximum number of iterations have been performed. Full details are given in Phillips et al. (2006). We used the 19 climatic variables, elevation and habitat as predictor variables.
Linear and quadratic terms were fitted for continuous variables. We used default values for all parameters (a regularization value of 1, a convergence threshold of 0.00001, a maximum of 500 iterations and a sample of 10,000 points to characterize
the background environment). Ten initial models were made for each species. For each model, the species data were randomly divided into half for building the model and half for evaluating the model. The accuracy of each model was assessed using
the âarea under the receiver operating characteristic curveâ (AUC) statistic, as calculated within the Maxent procedure. Following the recommendations made by Swets (1986), we eliminated five butterfly species and seven mammal species with mean
AUC scores of &amp;lt; 0.7. This left 35 butterfly species, including one of the two endemic species and both near-endemic species, and 61 mammal species, including three of the four endemic species and five out of 10 near-endemic species. &lt;br&gt;
A single final model was then made for each of the remaining species, again at a resolution of 30 arcsec, using the same modelling protocol, but this time using all presence records. The output of statistical models varies among species according
to the relative numbers of presences and absences in the species data (prevalence) (Manel et al., 2001). Therefore, simply summing the output of individual distribution models may bias estimates of species richness in favour of taxa with many
records. It is better to convert the model output into a binary prediction of presence or absence around a threshold value. Many methods have been proposed for choosing appropriate thresholds. For datasets consisting only of presences, Pearson et
al. (2004) recommended using a threshold that maximizes sensitivity (the percentage of presences correctly predicted as being present at a given threshold). Here we used a threshold that resulted in a sensitivity of 95%. Once the models had been
converted to binary predictions of presence or absence, they were summed across all species to give an estimate of species richness. &lt;br&gt;
The second method of modelling species richness was to model observed species richness values directly. This part of the study was concerned with the total number of species recorded in each cell rather than individual records of species.
Therefore, we used a resolution of 0.5Â°, because at the finer resolution most cells contained no records. Observed species richness was calculated from the original survey data in diva-gis 5.2 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.diva-gis.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.diva-gis.org/&lt;/a&gt;). A species was considered
present in a cell if it had been recorded at least once. Species richness was modelled using generalized linear models (GLMs) with the same independent variables as in the species distribution models. Following an inspection of the residuals of a
general linear model and consideration of dispersion, the most appropriate family of GLMs was chosen for each model. The variables were resampled to the coarser resolution using bilinear interpolation. In bilinear interpolation, the values of the
four nearest grid cells to the target cell are averaged after being weighted according to their distance to the target cell. Fitting too many independent variables in GLMs may result in overfitting and the selection of nonsense variables in the
final model (Wintle et al., 2005). To avoid these problems, we performed a principal components analysis (PCA) on the 19 climatic variables and elevation across all 406 of the 0.5Â° cells. Components with an eigenvalue &amp;gt; 1.0 were retained as new
predictor variables. In the GLMs, linear and quadratic terms were fitted for each of these components. We constructed two separate models of species richness: (1) assuming that cells with no species records had a species richness of zero; and (2)
excluding cells with a recorded species richness of zero. In the first we fitted recorded species richness values of all 406 of the 0.5Â° grid cells in the study area. We used a GLM with negative binomial errors (NB-GLM) and the log link (Crawley,
2002; Venables &amp;amp; Ripley, 2002). For the second model, since some cells with a recorded richness of zero may occur simply because they have not been sampled and the results could be biased by the inclusion of false zero values, we fitted the
species richness values of 0.5Â° cells with at least one record of the taxonomic group in question â 100 cells for butterflies and 196 cells for mammals. A GLM with Poisson errors (P-GLM) and the log link (McCullagh &amp;amp; Nelder, 1989) was used. &lt;br&gt;
Statistical analysis &lt;br&gt;
The agreement between fitted values of species richness generated using the different methods was tested using Spearmanâs rank correlation tests. For comparison, the species richness prediction generated by summing individual distribution models
was resampled from its original resolution of 30 arcsec to a resolution of 0.5Â° using bilinear interpolation. Thus, all tests compared species richness across all 362 of the 0.5Â° grid cells with an estimate of species richness by all three
models. These comparisons included cells with no species records; these cells were assumed to have a species richness of zero. We also repeated the same correlation tests using only cells that had at least one record of a species in the group
being considered. &lt;br&gt;
We tested whether Egyptâs protected areas network represented butterfly and mammal species richness well by comparing estimated (using the distribution model-sum method) and observed species richness inside and outside protected areas at 2000
points, randomly situated in 1-km cells throughout the study area. These points were generated using Hawthâs analysis tools for ArcMap 9.1 (Beyer, 2004). We also compared both estimated and observed richness of endemic and near-endemic species
inside and outside protected areas. For this comparison, we grouped mammals and butterflies because the number of endemic species was small. &lt;br&gt;
The NB-GLMs and P-GLMs were built using the glm (Poisson errors) and glm.nb (negative binomial errors) packages in R 2.6.1 (R Development Core Team, 2004). For both, a manual backward stepwise selection procedure was used to remove terms that did
not significantly improve the deviance explained, until a minimum adequate model was obtained (Crawley, 2002). All other analyses were carried out using spss 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). The comparison of actual and predicted species richness
inside and outside protected areas was undertaken using a MannâWhitney U-test. &lt;br&gt;
Results &lt;br&gt;
The species occurrence data showed no biases in environmental space that would preclude accurate modelling. Sampled sites covered the full range of values of each of the principal components based on the climatic variables. The butterfly sampling
locations fell into 44 of 256 areas of climatic space, 84.1% of the number expected by chance. Sites that were sampled for mammals covered 76 areas of climatic space, 107.5% of the number expected by chance. Sites for both butterflies and mammals
fell into significantly different proportions of habitat types than expected by chance (Ï2 = 1035, d.f. = 9, p 0.001 and Ï2 = 2248, d.f. = 9, p 0.001, respectively). For both butterflies and mammals, littoral coastal areas, cultivated land, wadis
(dry desert valleys), areas of metamorphic rock and areas of igneous rock were sampled more often than expected by chance. Sand dunes, gravels, serir sand sheets and areas of sedimentary rock were sampled less often than expected by chance.
Sixty-three of 333 butterfly sites and 200 of 1395 mammal sites fell inside Egyptâs protected areas. A map of Egyptâs protected areas and the sites that were sampled for mammals and butterflies is given in Fig. 1(a). &lt;br&gt;
(a) Sites where mammals (circles) and butterflies (triangles) were sampled, and the location of Egyptâs protected areas (grey shading). Maps of (b) predicted butterfly and &amp;copy; mammal species richness generated by summing individual predictions of
the distributions of species. Lighter tones indicate high predicted species richness and darker tones indicate lower species richness. The distribution predictions were made using Maxent. &lt;br&gt;
The final distribution models (those using all the species occurrence data) achieved mean AUC values between 0.863 and 0.999 for butterfly species and between 0.831 and 0.999 for mammal species. The average relative contribution of habitat,
elevation and the 19 climatic variables to the final distribution models is shown in Fig. S2 in Appendix S1, and the contributions of variables in the models for each species are given in Appendix S2. Habitat and elevation were important in
explaining the distributions of both butterflies and mammals. Among the climatic predictors, temperature-related variables were more important than precipitation-related variables in determining butterfly distributions, while for mammals, annual
and maximum precipitation variables were also important. &lt;br&gt;
The predictions of species richness made using the first method (summing distribution models for individual species) are mapped in Fig. 1(b,c). The models of species richness generated using this method correlated positively and significantly
with observed species richness (Table 1, Fig. 2a). The second method of estimating spatial patterns of species richness was to model species richness values directly. The PCA of the 19 climatic variables and elevation produced four components
with eigenvalues &amp;gt; 1.0. All original climate variables were represented in at least one of the extracted components (Table S1 in Appendix S1). Scores on the first principal component increased with increasing maximum temperature and decreasing
precipitation annually and at otherwise wet times of year (Table S1 in Appendix S1). The second component increased with increasing annual temperature and increasing temperature during cooler periods of the year. The third component described
increasing elevation, decreasing annual temperature and increasing precipitation at drier times of the year. The fourth component increased with decreasing temperature during dry periods, increasing precipitation (annually and during cold times
of the year) and decreasing minimum precipitation. The models fitting species richness values for all 406 of the 0.5Â° cells (NB-GLM), which included cells with a recorded species richness of zero, explained 16.3% of the deviance in the species
richness of butterfly species and 21.3% of the deviance in mammal species richness. For butterflies, only the linear term of PC1 (describing mainly precipitation but also maximum temperature) and habitat had a significant effect on species
richness (Table 2). For mammals, habitat, the quadratic term of PC1 and both terms of PC2 (describing several temperature-related variables) and PC4 (describing variables related to extremes of temperature and rainfall) had a significant effect
on species richness (Table 2). Estimated species richness according to the NB-GLMs correlated significantly and positively with observed species richness (Table 1, Fig. 2b). The models fitting species richness values only for 0.5Â° cells with at
least one species record (P-GLM) explained 19.1% of the deviance in butterfly species richness and 18.3% of the deviance in mammal richness. For butterflies, both terms of PC1 and PC4, the quadratic term of PC3 (high values of which indicate
high-altitude areas with rainfall all year round) and habitat were all significantly related to species richness (Table 3). For mammals, both terms of PC1, the quadratic terms of PC2 and PC4, the linear term of PC3 and habitat were significant
predictors of species richness (Table 3). Species richness estimates from these models also correlated significantly and positively with observed species richness (Table 1, Fig. 2c). Across all 0.5Â° grid cells, the estimates made using the
different modelling methods correlated significantly with each other (Table 1, Fig. 3). &lt;br&gt;
Table 1. Correlations among fitted values of each of the three models of species richness of butterflies (B) and mammals (M) in Egypt, and correlations between these fitted values and observed species richness. The three models of species
richness were: (1) summed distributions â distribution models were built for each species at 30 arcsec resolution using Maxent, then summed to estimate species richness; (2) NB-GLM â species richness values of all 0.5Â° cells were fitted using a
generalized linear model (GLM) with negative binomial errors; (3) P-GLM â species richness values of sampled cells were fitted using a GLM with Poisson errors. Correlations were calculated both for all cells and for sampled cells only. Species
richness values cannot be considered independent in the presence of spatial autocorrelation; the effective sample size is reduced in the presence of such non-independence. Therefore, the minimum sample sizes at which the reported correlation
coefficients would remain significant (at Î± = 0.05) are given in brackets after the correlation coefficient. &lt;br&gt;
Correlations between observed species richness and predicted species richness of butterflies and mammals in Egypt estimated using each of the three models: (a) predictions of the distribution of each species, produced using Maxent, were summed;
(b) recorded species richness values of all grid cells were modelled using a generalized linear model with negative binomial errors; and &amp;copy; recorded species richness values of sampled grid cells were modelled using a generalized linear model
with Poisson errors.

Correlations between the different models used to predict species richness patterns of butterflies and mammals in Egypt: (a) between the sum of individual species distribution models and the generalized linear model with negative binomial errors
(NB-GLM) of species richness values; (b) between the sum of individual species distribution models and the generalized linear model with Poisson errors (P-GLM) of species richness values; and &amp;copy; between the NB-GLM and P-GLM models of species
richness values. y = x lines are shown for reference. &lt;br&gt;
Observed mammal and butterfly species richness values correlated significantly with each other at sites where at least one butterfly species and one mammal species had been recorded (rs = 0.615, n = 97, p 0.001). Predicted species richness
(estimated using the distribution model-sum method) also correlated strongly and significantly between butterflies and mammals (rs = 0.920, n = 362, p 0.001). &lt;br&gt;
Across a random sample of 2000 1-km grid cells, predicted species richness, estimated by summing individual modelled species distributions, of both butterflies (MannâWhitney test: U = 76,100, n = 1995, p 0.001) and mammals (MannâWhitney test: U =
70,300, n = 1995, p 0.001) was significantly higher inside protected areas than outside (Fig. 4a). The observed species richness was also significantly higher inside protected areas than outside for both butterflies (MannâWhitney test: U =
111,000, n = 1995, P = 0.016) and mammals (MannâWhitney test: U = 80,700, n = 1995, p 0.001) (Fig. 4b). Predicted (MannâWhitney test: U = 105,000, n = 1963, P = 0.028) and observed (MannâWhitney test: U = 102,000, n = 1963, P = 0.001) richness of
endemic and near-endemic species (mammals and butterflies combined) was significantly higher inside protected areas than outside. &lt;br&gt;

Discussion &lt;br&gt;
We found significant relationships between species occurrence, species richness and the climate and habitat variables that we used. Beale et al. (2008) found that relationships between species occurrence and environmental variables were no better
than expected by chance. However, we found that habitat and climate variables both had a significant effect on butterfly and mammal distributions, and on patterns of species richness, at least at the local scale at which we carried out this
study. This finding is consistent with previous studies of butterflies and mammals, where climate and habitat have been identified as good predictors of richness, both at continental and at local scales (e.g. NoguÃ©s-Bravo &amp;amp; AraÃºjo, 2006; Algar et
al., 2007; Kivinen et al., 2007; Levinsky et al., 2007). The association with habitat may reflect the effect of variation in plant communities on animal species distributions. Butterflies and herbivorous mammals are directly dependent on plants
for food, whilst other mammal species may rely on certain vegetation types indirectly, for example through the availability of herbivorous prey. Temperature variables appear to have a particularly strong effect on butterfly species, although
causality cannot be inferred from correlative models. Similar relationships have been noted before (Turner et al., 1987) and could be brought about by direct effects of temperature on thermoregulation, or indirectly through climate-driven
variation in habitat diversity or plant productivity. &lt;br&gt;
Many other factors in addition to climate may affect species richness, including competition (Anderson et al., 2002), the availability of host plants (AraÃºjo &amp;amp; Luoto, 2007), metapopulation dynamics (Hanski, 1991), human disturbance (Uehara-Prado
et al., 2007) and other environmental variables such as soil type (Kuussaari et al., 2007), although some of these factors are likely to play a role in determining species richness only at larger spatial scales than were studied here (Whittaker
et al., 2001). Given all these non-climatic determinants of species richness patterns, it is not surprising that only a relatively low proportion of the variation in species richness was explained by the models, and that the correlations between
modelled and observed species richness were only moderately strong. Some progress is being made towards including factors other than climatic ones in species distribution models (e.g. AraÃºjo &amp;amp; Luoto, 2007) and this must remain a priority for
improving the accuracy of predictions. However, the need to identify areas to conserve is urgent and we cannot wait to act until the most accurate models possible have been built for every species. Climate-based models match observed
distributions well and are quick and easy to build for a large number of species. &lt;br&gt;
Another reason for the relatively low explanatory power of the models may be that species inventories in sampled cells were incomplete. This seems likely, given that it may be necessary to visit a site many times before absence can be inferred
with confidence (MacKenzie et al., 2002). In the case of the NB-GLMs, the inclusion of cells with no records of species presence may have introduced false absences to the models. This is especially likely for the butterfly models, because
surveying was less extensive. Ground-truthing will be required to assess the extent to which mismatches between modelled and observed species richness are due to incomplete inventories or to errors in the models. &lt;br&gt;
Across all grid cells in the study area, the three methods produced models that showed positive correlations with observed species richness and with each other, suggesting that they could all be used to predict the species richness of unknown
areas from limited data on the distributions of species, an application that would be of great value for conservation. There were some differences among the models though. Species occurrence and richness data often contain many absences or zero
values, especially datasets for small or cryptic species with a low probability of detection (MacKenzie et al., 2002). This can bias the parameter estimates of statistical models (Martin et al., 2005). The weaker correlations between observed
species richness and species richness estimated using the NB-GLMs (those that included cells with recorded species richness of zero), especially for butterflies, may be caused by the inclusion of false absences. This conclusion is further
supported by the observation that the NB-GLMs produced much lower estimates of species richness than the other two methods (see Fig. 3). The mammal data covered a much larger proportion of both geographical and environmental space than the
butterfly data, suggesting that recorded species richness values of zero were more reliable. &lt;br&gt;
Summing the individual distribution models produced the best estimates of species richness. The relationship between predicted and observed species richness across sampled cells was slightly weaker for butterflies, which may be a result of model
bias caused by false absence records. This would be concerning, given that Maxent is designed to be used with datasets containing only presences (Phillips et al., 2006) and is a possibility that deserves further attention. However, for both
butterflies and mammals, summing distribution models produced the estimates of species richness that matched observed species richness most closely. The P-GLM models, which did not include cells with a recorded species richness of zero, generated
more accurate estimates of species richness than the NB-GLM models. GLMs are quick and easy models to build, making them a good first choice for modelling species richness patterns. &lt;br&gt;
Some previous work has indicated good spatial agreement among different groups in their species richness at regional scales (Qian, 2007), although a global study of bird, mammal and amphibian species richness found the converse (e.g. Grenyer et
al., 2006). The results of this study show that, at least at a local scale within a single country, butterfly and mammal diversity correlate strongly and positively. &lt;br&gt;
In contrast to the findings for many other countries and taxonomic groups (e.g. Evans et al., 2006; Pawar et al., 2007; Traba et al., 2007), Egyptâs protected areas network seems to be effective in representing butterfly and mammal diversity. In
many parts of the world, protected areas have historically included land that has relatively little commercial value; such areas do not necessarily represent the best choice in terms of conserving biodiversity (Margules &amp;amp; Pressey, 2000). Egyptâs
protected areas network is relatively new and the areas were chosen with the aid of knowledge about the countryâs biodiversity. Given such knowledge, and the ability to overcome conflicting interests over land use, it seems that good coverage of
biodiversity can be achieved. On the other hand, large areas of the Nile Valley and Delta were predicted to have relatively high butterfly diversity but are not yet protected, suggesting that although great progress has been made towards
protecting species-rich areas, more could still be done. The Nile Valley contains land of high economic value, and setting aside areas to be protected may present a challenge. It is important to note that species richness is only one measure of
the importance of conserving different areas. Some authors have suggested using taxonomic uniqueness (e.g. Kershaw et al., 1995), complementarity (Margules &amp;amp; Pressey, 2000) or threat (Wilson et al., 2007) instead. Many of Egyptâs endemic and
near-endemic mammal and butterfly species were included in the models and the richness of endemic and near-endemic species was higher inside protected areas than outside, but a more comprehensive assessment of the protected areas should consider
a number of different criteria. &lt;br&gt;
In summary, we have shown that seemingly accurate estimates of species richness can be made using patchy, incomplete data, allowing us to predict the species richness of sites that have not been surveyed. The three models of species richness were
largely similar, although the model based on individual distribution models produced the most consistently accurate results. A similar comparison of the same three models in different regions and for different species would be useful in
establishing the general reliability of the approach. Models based on species richness itself, rather than individual species distributions, may be useful when species identity is unknown, for example when using species richness estimators. The
results are important for conservation, given the urgency with which we must identify areas that need to be protected, although similar comparisons of species richness models for more taxonomic groups and for a broader geographical region would
be useful. &lt;br&gt;

Effect of characteristics of butterfly species on the accuracy of distribution models in an arid environment&lt;br&gt;
Biodiversity &amp;amp; Conservation 18: 3629-41.&lt;br&gt;
10.1007/s10531-009-9668-5&lt;br&gt;
Species distribution models show great promise as tools for conservation ecology. However, their accuracy has been shown to vary widely among taxa. There is some evidence that this variation is partly owing to ecological differences among species,
which make them more or less easy to model. Here we test the effect of five characteristics of Egyptian butterfly species on the accuracy of distribution models, the first such comparison for butterflies in an arid environment. Unlike most
previous studies, we perform independent contrasts to control for species relatedness. We show that range size, both globally and locally, has a negative effect on model accuracy. The results shed light on causes of variation in distribution model
accuracy among species, and hence have relevance to practitioners using species distribution models in conservation decision making. &lt;br&gt;
Species distribution models have great potential to aid conservation efforts, allowing ecologists to predict species distributions over a large area, using incomplete data on species occurrence combined with maps of environmental variables,
describing climate, habitat and topography (Wintle et al. 2005). Many studies have compared the accuracy of predictions made by different modelling techniques, often finding that many techniques perform similarly well (Elith et al. 2006; Hernandez
et al. 2006; Phillips et al. 2006). In fact, there may be more variation in model accuracy among species than among modelling techniques (Berg et al. 2004; Elith et al. 2006). As a result, whether the characteristics of species affect the accuracy
of distribution models is a question that is receiving increasing attention in the literature. &lt;br&gt;
The breadth of a speciesâs niche has often been considered when trying to explain differences in model accuracy among species. Studies have found that species with narrow, well-defined niches are better modelled than those with broader niches
(Boone and Krohn 1999; Pearce et al. 2001; Kadmon et al. 2003; Berg et al. 2004) and that models for specialist species are generally more accurate than models for generalists (Hepinstall et al. 2002; Segurado and AraÃºjo 2004; Elith et al. 2006).
Species with narrow niches generally have better-defined climate and habitat requirements, which are easier to model (Kadmon et al. 2003). Other studies have shown that the breadth of a speciesâ niche relative to the environmental conditions found
in the study area as a whole influences model accuracy more than the breadth of a speciesâ niche per se (Seoane et al. 2005; Hernandez et al. 2006). More marginal species (those that have niches furthest from the average conditions of the study
area) have also been shown to be modelled more accurately than less marginal species, probably for similar reasons (Luoto et al. 2005; Seoane et al. 2005; Carrascal et al. 2006; Hernandez et al. 2006). We might expect therefore that the accuracy
of species distribution models will decrease with increasing niche breadth or habitat tolerance. &lt;br&gt;
Models for species that have narrow distributions in geographical space have also been found to be more accurate than models for species with larger distributions (Stockwell and Peterson 2002; Brotons et al. 2004; Segurado and AraÃºjo 2004;
Hernandez et al. 2006). This may be related to the effect of niche width, with smaller range size being associated with better-defined habitat requirements (Brotons et al. 2004; Hernandez et al. 2006). Alternatively, populations of species with
larger ranges may show local adaptation to different environmental conditions, decreasing the accuracy of models that consider all populations together (Stockwell and Peterson 2002; Brotons et al. 2004). Similarly, McPherson and Jetz (2007) found
that endemic species were modelled more accurately than non-endemic species; this effect may be related to the effects of local range size and niche breadth or may be because the environmental gradients inhabited are incompletely sampled in the
case of non-endemics (McPherson and Jetz 2007). Overall, we expect species with smaller range sizes, both on local and regional scales, to be modelled more accurately than species with larger ranges. Tests of the effect of range size on model
accuracy may be confounded by statistical artefacts. The AUC statistic is a common measure of the accuracy of species distribution models and has been used in many of the studies reviewed here. However, it may be biassed in favour of species with
narrow ranges (Lobo et al. 2008). &lt;br&gt;
Only a few studies have considered the effect of migratory behaviour on the accuracy of distribution models. All such studies have focused on birds, most finding that models for migratory species were poorer than models for non-migratory species
(Pearce et al. 2001; McPherson and Jetz 2007), probably because the distributions of migratory species are determined by environmental conditions at very specific times of the year (McPherson and Jetz 2007). Conversely, Stockwell and Peterson
(2002) found no difference in model accuracy between migratory and non-migratory species, and Mitchell et al. (2001) found that models for migratory bird species were better than models for resident species. No previous study has compared model
accuracy between migratory and non-migratory butterfly species. PÃ¶yry et al. (2008) showed that more mobile butterfly species were better modelled than less mobile species, probably because more mobile species can expand their ranges into
uninhabited areas more easily and hence occupy a greater proportion of the suitable habitat than less mobile species (but see Pearce et al. 2001). We expect distribution models to be more accurate for resident butterfly species than for migratory
species. &lt;br&gt;
There is evidence that both sample size and prevalence (the relative number of presence and absence records) affect the accuracy of distribution models (Manel et al. 1999; Stockwell and Peterson 2002; Brotons et al. 2004; Luoto et al. 2005; Seoane
et al. 2005). Therefore, it is important to account for these factors when comparing model accuracy among species (Karl et al. 2002; Huntley et al. 2004; McPherson et al. 2004). Reported effects of prevalence on model accuracy have been mixed,
including both positive and negative relationships (Luoto et al. 2005; Brotons et al. 2004), but we expect model accuracy to increase with sample size. &lt;br&gt;
Some authors have demonstrated evolutionary conservatism of ecological niches (Peterson et al. 1999). Furthermore, there may be a substantial heritability in many of the characteristics of species used to explain differences in model accuracy,
particularly range size (Jablonski 1987; Hunt et al. 2005; Beck et al. 2006; but see Webb and Gaston 2003). However, to date, only one study has controlled for phylogeny when investigating differences in distribution model accuracy among species
(PÃ¶yry et al. 2008). In this case, incorporating phylogeny did not affect the results, but this may not be true for other taxonomic groups, regions or characteristics of species. &lt;br&gt;
In this study, we test the effect of five characteristics of species (local range size, global range size, migratory behaviour, host-plant specialisation and habitat tolerance) on the accuracy of distribution models for butterflies in Egypt,
controlling for the potentially confounding effects of sample size and prevalence on model accuracy. Two separate measures of model accuracy were used to minimise the impact of statistical bias on our conclusions. We also control for the influence
of species relatedness using independent contrasts. &lt;br&gt;
Materials and methods &lt;br&gt;
Data describing the occurrence of 59 butterfly species in Egypt were compiled as part of Egyptâs BioMAP project (Gilbert and Zalat 2007). The species data were collected between 1829 and 2006, but most records date from the 20th Century (Newbold
et al. 2009). We used five environmental variables as predictors: four principal components, which describe altitude and 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim (Hijmans et al. 2005), and a categorical land cover variable based on AVHRR satellite
data (Hansen et al. 2000). Land cover is classified into 13 categories globallyâneedleleaf evergreen forest, broadleaf evergreen forest, needleleaf deciduous forest, broadleaf deciduous forest, mixed forest, woodland, wooded grassland, closed
shrubland, open shrubland, grassland, cropland, bare ground, and urban areas (Hansen et al. 2000)âeight of which are found in Egypt. All variables had a resolution of 30 arc seconds (~1 km). &lt;br&gt;
Models were built with Maxent Version 2.3 (Phillips et al. 2006). We generated distribution models for 40 species with at least eight occurrence records. The datasets for each species were divided randomly, with half the records used for model
building and half for model evaluation. For each species we built ten models, using different subsets of the data to build and evaluate each. &lt;br&gt;
We initially evaluated the models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). AUC values were calculated using the trapezoid method (Pearce and Ferrier 2000a). Its calculation requires both presence and absence records.
We generated 2,500 pseudo-absences, randomly situated in grid cells with no recorded occurrence of a given species. The AUC statistic may be sensitive to the extent of the study area and the proportion of this area that the species inhabits. As an
additional evaluation of model performance, we fitted a generalised linear model (GLM) with binomial errors using the presences and pseudo-absences reserved for model evaluation as the dependent variable and the model predicted probability of
occurrence at these sites as a single independent variable. The deviance explained by this model was used as a measure of model accuracy. Negative values indicate negative relationships between model predicted probability and observed occurrence.
AUC values and deviances explained were averaged across all ten model runs for each species. &lt;br&gt;
We considered six characteristics of species that may affect the accuracy of distribution models: (1) the mean number of presence records used in the ten model runs; (2) whether the species is a migrant, partial migrant or resident in Egypt; (3)
whether the species is a specialist or generalist in terms of the host plants it uses; (4) the speciesâ inhabited range size within Egypt; (5) its global range size (endemic, near-endemic, restricted-range, narrowly distributed or widespread); and
(6) its habitat tolerance. Migratory behaviour data were taken from Gilbert and Zalat (2007). Species were defined as specialists if their host plants are confined to one genus and as generalists otherwise, according to Gilbert and Zalat (2007).
Maxent outputs a cumulative predicted probability of occurrence for each model between 0 and 100. The mean proportion of grid cells with a predicted value of greater than 50 (averaged across the ten model runs for each species) was used as an
index of range size within Egypt. Global range size followed the classifications used in Gilbert and Zalat (2007). The breadth of a speciesâ habitat tolerance was estimated as the number of land cover categories into which recorded species
occurrences fell into. &lt;br&gt;
The results of cross-species comparisons may be confounded by an effect of species relatedness on their niches and on the species characteristics considered. To control for this we calculated independent contrasts for both measures of model
accuracy and all six characteristics of species (Harvey and Pagel 1991). One species characteristic (migratory behaviour) was a categorical variable with more than two categories, so we reclassified it into a series of binary variables, one for
each category of the original variable. A phylogenetic topology was generated based on published studies (Pieridae: Pollock et al. 1998; Braby et al. 2006; Lycaenidae: Pierce et al. 2002; Pech et al. 2004; Nymphalidae: Brower 2000; Wahlberg et al.
2003; Freitas and Brown 2004; All groups: GarcÃ­a-Barros 2000; Wahlberg et al. 2005). In the absence of data describing branch lengths, all branches were assigned a length of one, assuming punctuational evolution (Bro-JÃ¸rgensen 2007). We inserted
small branches of length 0.0001 in to polytomous clades. The phylogenetic tree was constructed in TreeView 1.6.6 (Page 1996) and modified using Mesquite 1.12 (Maddison and Maddison 2007). The independent contrasts were calculated using Compare
Version 4.6b (Martins 2004). &lt;br&gt;
Statistical analysis &lt;br&gt;
We arc-sin transformed model-accuracy measures (both AUC values and deviance explained) to meet assumptions of normality where appropriate. The effects of species characteristics on model accuracy were assessed using analyses of covariance; these
analyses took AUC values and deviances explained by the models as the dependent variables, respectively. The six species characteristics were considered as independent variables. Preliminary analysis suggested that two-way interactions did not
have a significant effect on model accuracy, so these were excluded from the final analyses. &lt;br&gt;
We used a model selection method based on the approach recommended by Burnham and Anderson (2002). First, we built a global model with all six terms, and candidate models with every combination of terms. AIC scores were extracted for each model
and the difference between a modelâs AIC value and the lowest value of all models (the AIC difference, Îi) was calculated. Model weight was calculated using the following formula (Burnham and Anderson 2002): &lt;br&gt;
where Îi is the AIC difference of the model in question and Îrs are the AIC differences of the other models. The relative importance of each variable was assessed by summing the AIC weights of all candidate models containing it (Burnham and
Anderson 2002), hereafter referred to as the âsum of AIC weightsâ. To test the effect of including species with very small numbers of presence records on the conclusions drawn, we repeated the same analyses considering only the 22 species with
more than 20 unique presence records. &lt;br&gt;
Relationships among independent contrasts for model accuracy measures and species characteristics were analysed using Pearsonâs correlation tests. &lt;br&gt;
All statistical tests were carried out in SPSS Version 15.0 and R Version 2.6.1 (R Development Core Team 2004). &lt;br&gt;
Results &lt;br&gt;
Models were generally accurate, attaining a mean AUC value of 0.83 Â± 0.015 and explained a mean deviance in species occurrence of 23.31 Â± 2.98. Predicted range size within Egypt had a strong negative effect on model performance, using both AUC
values (sum of AIC weights = 0.921; Table 1; Fig. 1a) and deviances explained by the models (sum of AIC weights = 0.997; Table 2; Fig. 1b) as measures of model accuracy. World range also had a strong negative effect on model accuracy, measured
using both AUC values (sum of AIC weights = 0.733; Table 1; Fig. 1c) and the deviance explained by the models (sum of AIC weights = 0.988; Table 2; Fig. 1d). World range and range within Egypt did not correlate significantly with one another
(Spearman rank correlation: rs = 0.120, n = 40, P &amp;gt; 0.05). There was limited support for an effect on model accuracy of the number of presence records used to build models (sum of AIC weights = 0.347 and 0.453, for AUC values and deviances
explained by models, respectively), migratory behaviour (sum of AIC weights = 0.382 and 0.224), host-plant specificity (sum of AIC weights = 0.316 and 0.318) or habitat tolerance (sum of AIC weights = 0.302 and 0.411). Considering only species
with more than 20 unique presence records did not qualitatively alter the results, although migratory behaviour appeared to be a more important determinant of model accuracy in these analyses (Tables 3, 4 in Appendix). &lt;br&gt;
Results of a set of general linear models testing the effect of species characteristics on the accuracy of species distribution models for 40 Egyptian butterfly species, measured using the AUC statistic &lt;br&gt;
Characteristics tested were: the number of presence records used to build models (P), migratory behaviour (M), host-plant specificity (S), predicted range size in Egypt &amp;reg;, world range size (W) and habitat tolerance (H). Candidate models were
built with every possible combination of terms. These models were compared using the approach recommended by Burnham and Anderson (2002), by calculating AIC values for each model, the difference between the AIC for a model and the minimum AIC for
all models (Îi), and model weights based on these values. We only present the best models (Îi â¤ 2) here &lt;br&gt;
Effect of species characteristics on model accuracy. Accuracy was measured using both the AUC statistic and the deviance explained by the models. Species characteristics that had a significant effect on model accuracy are shown: predicted range
within Egypt (a, b) and world range (c, d). With the exception of the effect of predicted range size within Egypt on AUC scores, all relationships remained significant after accounting for species relatedness using independent contrasts &lt;br&gt;

When species relatedness was accounted for using independent contrasts, world range still showed a significant negative relationship with model accuracy, estimated using both AUC (rp = â0.323, N = 39, P = 0.045) and deviance explained by the
models (rp = â0.478, N = 39, P = 0.002). Predicted range within Egypt showed a significant negative relationship with deviance explained by the models (rp = â0.394, N = 39, P = 0.013), but not with average AUC score (rp = â0.110, N = 39, P =
0.506). All other characteristics tested did not have a significant effect on model accuracy after accounting for the relatedness of species (â0.241 â¤ rp â¤ 0.172, N = 39, P &amp;gt; 0.05). &lt;br&gt;
Discussion &lt;br&gt;
Our results confirm that characteristics of species can strongly affect model accuracy, although the factors considered explained a relatively small proportion of the variation in accuracy measures. Of the six characteristics that we tested, two
had consistent significant effects on model performance. Disentangling causal mechanisms for patterns such as these is difficult because range size shows relationships with abundance and occupancy (Gaston et al. 2000), and also with ecological
characteristics of species, such as dispersal ability and niche breadth (Beck and Kitching 2007). However, our results are consistent with hypothesised relationships between range size and the accuracy of distribution models. &lt;br&gt;
Species with large local range sizes had less accurate models than those with small range sizes. This is consistent with the results of other studies (Stockwell and Peterson 2002; Brotons et al. 2004; Segurado and AraÃºjo 2004; Hernandez et al.
2006). Species with small ranges included both desert species and species inhabiting the Nile Valley and Delta, thus the effect of range size was not an artefact of certain habitats containing better-modelled species. Some authors have suggested
that species with smaller ranges have better-defined habitat requirements, making them easier to model (Brotons et al. 2004; Hernandez et al. 2006). However, contrary to the findings of other studies (Boone and Krohn 1999; Pearce et al. 2001;
Kadmon et al. 2003; Berg et al. 2004), we found no evidence of an effect of habitat tolerance on the accuracy of species distribution models. A similar study to our own, comparing model accuracy among butterfly species in a temperate environment
(PÃ¶yry et al. 2008), also found no effect of niche breadth. Therefore, it would seem that other characteristics of butterfly species may be more important in determining the accuracy of butterfly distribution models, or that aspects of niche
breadth that determine model accuracy are not captured by the measures used. &lt;br&gt;
It has been suggested that the AUC statistic may be biased in favour of species that occupy a small proportion of the study area (Lobo et al. 2008), which may explain the existence of negative relationships between range size and model accuracy.
However, in our study, the effect of range size was the same for two independent measures of model accuracy, suggesting that the relationship was not an artefact associated with use of the AUC statistic. More generally, the use of pseudo-absences
may affect measures of model accuracy (VanDer Wal et al. 2009) and thus relationships between range size and model accuracy. However, we found a strong effect of both global and local range size on model accuracy. While the effect of local range
size may be affected by statistical artefacts, the effect of global range size should not. &lt;br&gt;
Species with larger ranges may be modelled less accurately because the study area contains discrete populations that show different responses to the environment (Stockwell and Peterson 2002; Brotons et al. 2004). Although some studies suggest that
niches are highly evolutionarily conserved (Peterson et al. 1999), others have found that organisms can adapt their niches very rapidly in certain situations (Knouft et al. 2006). The existence of different populations within species that respond
differently to the environment is certainly possible in our study; at least two butterfly species (Carcharodus stauderi and Spialia doris) are known to be represented by two sub-species in Egypt (Gilbert and Zalat 2007). Furthermore, the Nile
River, Suez Canal and the mountains of the Eastern and Sinai Deserts may present dispersal barriers for some species, causing isolation of populations. &lt;br&gt;
Global range size also had a strong effect on the accuracy of our models. Predictions for endemic, near-endemic and restricted-range species were better than those for more widespread species. This has been shown before for birds (McPherson and
Jetz 2007), and recently for butterflies (Marmion et al. 2008). It has been suggested that endemic species are modelled more accurately because the environmental gradients that they inhabit have been completely sampled, whereas only part of the
total inhabited environmental space is sampled for non-endemics (McPherson and Jetz 2007). Alternatively, the effect of global range may be brought about by similar mechanisms to the effect of local range size, i.e. larger-ranged species having
locally-adapted populations (e.g. Stockwell and Peterson 2002) or having broader habitat requirements that are more difficult to model (e.g. Hernandez et al. 2006). &lt;br&gt;
Previous studies have suggested that the distributions of specialist species are better modelled than those of generalist species (Hepinstall et al. 2002; Segurado and AraÃºjo 2004; Elith et al. 2006). Ours is the first study to test for this
effect in butterflies, and we find little evidence that specialists and generalists differ in the accuracy of their distribution models. Butterflies are dependent on certain plant species as host plants and the distribution of these plants can
strongly affect the distribution of the butterflies (AraÃºjo and Luoto 2007, but see Quinn et al. 1998). Therefore, it may be the identity, rather than the number, of host plants that affects the accuracy of butterfly distribution models. If the
distribution of a butterflyâs host plant is largely determined by climate and habitat, then we might expect that a model for the butterfly that is based on climate and habitat variables will be more accurate than if the host-plantâs distribution
is determined by other factors. &lt;br&gt;
Few studies have considered the effect of migratory behaviour on the accuracy of species distribution models and these have focused on bird species, generally finding that migrant species are modelled less accurately than resident species (Pearce
et al. 2001; McPherson and Jetz 2007). If anything, partial migrants had the least accurate models in this study. One possible explanation is that the distributions of both residents and migrants are strongly determined by environmental variables,
but that each responds slightly differently to those variables. If partially-migratory species consist of separate populations of migrants and residents, then their distribution models will be less accurate than species that are entirely migratory
or entirely resident and respond consistently to the environmental variables. Given the weak trend suggested in our data, more work is needed to explore this phenomenon further. &lt;br&gt;
Several authors have reported a significant effect of sample size on model accuracy (Pearce and Ferrier 2000b; Stockwell and Peterson 2002; Phillips et al. 2004; Hernandez et al. 2006), although this effect has been shown to vary among modelling
techniques. In this study we used Maxent to build our models and found no relationship between sample size and model performance. This supports the results of other studies that have shown that Maxent is generally robust to variation in sample
size and that it produces accurate predictions even with very small samples (e.g. Hernandez et al. 2008). Most studies of the effects of sample size on model performance (Pearce and Ferrier 2000b; Stockwell and Peterson 2002; Phillips et al. 2004;
Hernandez et al. 2006) have experimentally altered sample sizes for one species. We tested the effect of the available sample size across many species. It may be that the completeness of sampling with respect to the environmental gradients rather
than sample size alone is most important in determining model accuracy, although Kadmon et al. (2003) found that distribution-model accuracy decreased with the completeness of sampling with respect to climatic gradients. &lt;br&gt;
It is important to account for the effect of species relatedness in comparisons of models across species; otherwise, false conclusions may be drawn regarding the effect of some species characteristics on model accuracy, as is the case in other
comparative studies (e.g. Harvey and Pagel 1991). Although accounting for species relatedness had no effect on the conclusions of this study, species distributions, and also some of the species characteristics tested, are known to be
evolutionarily conserved (Jablonski 1987; Peterson et al. 1999; Hunt et al. 2005). &lt;br&gt;
The results have important consequences, both for species distribution modelling itself and for conservation biology more generally. It is important to understand why models for different species perform differently before using them to make
conservation decisions. This is the first test of differences in accuracy among distribution models of butterflies in an arid environment. The results are generally consistent with those of similar studies of butterflies in other parts of the
world, although we present the first test of the effects of migratory behaviour and host-plant specialism on the accuracy of models for butterfly species. It is important to note that the factors that determine species distributions vary according
to the scale of analysis (Whittaker et al. 2001), and thus the characteristics of species that affect distribution-model accuracy may also differ. We also emphasise that it is important to control for phylogeny when conducting cross-species
comparisons like this one. Although there was substantial variation among species in model accuracy, accurate models were produced for many species, confirming the value of such models in conservation ecology. &lt;br&gt;

To check that our conclusions were not biased by including species with very small numbers of presence records, we repeated the analyses of the effect of characteristics of species on distribution model accuracy, considering only species with at
least 20 unique presence records. See Tables 3 and 4. &lt;br&gt;
Results of a set of general linear models testing the effect of species characteristics on the accuracy of species distribution models for 22 Egyptian butterfly species with at least 20 unique presence records, measured using the AUC statistic &lt;br&gt;
Characteristics tested were: the number of presence records used to build models (P), migratory behaviour (M), host-plant specificity (S), predicted range size in Egypt &amp;reg;, world range size (W) and habitat tolerance (H). Candidate models were
built with every possible combination of terms. These models were compared using the approach recommended by Burnham and Anderson (2002), by calculating AIC values for each model, the difference between the AIC for a model and the minimum AIC for
all models (Îi), and model weights based on these values. We only present the best models (Îi â¤ 2) here &lt;br&gt;
