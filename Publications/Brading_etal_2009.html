        <strong>Abstract: </strong> Pollinator populations are under severe pressure worldwide because of man-made intensification in land use, including the use of pesticides and fertilizers. The majority of  wild  and  crop  plants  are  fully  or  partially  dependent  on  pollinators  for  their reproduction.  Loss  of  pollinators  has  already  caused  measurable  declines  in the populations of many wild plants in Europe. Many Egyptian crops are fully or partially dependent  on  pollinators  for  their  yields,  and  data  exist  on  the  market  values  of  Egyptian  crops.  We  therefore  use  these  to  estimate  the  2004  costs  to  the  Egyptian economy  of  a  catastrophic  loss  of  pollinators.  The  annual  cost  to  the  Egyptian economy  of  los ing  its  pollinators  would  be  approximately  LE  13.5  billion  ($2.4 billion), 3.3% of the 2003 GDP.<br><br>
