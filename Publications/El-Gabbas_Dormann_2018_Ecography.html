            Species distribution modelling (SDM) has become an essential method in ecology and conservation. In the absence of survey data, the majority of SDMs are calibrated with opportunistic presence-only data, incurring substantial sampling bias. We address
            the challenge of correcting for sampling bias in the data-sparse situations of developing countries. We modelled the relative intensity of bat records in their entire range using three modelling algorithms under the point-process modelling
            framework (GLMs with subset selection, GLMs fitted with an elastic net penalty, and Maxent). To correct for sampling bias, we applied model-based bias correction by incorporating spatial information on site accessibility or sampling efforts.
            We evaluated the effect of bias correction on the models' predictive performance (AUC and TSS), calculated on spatial-block cross-validation and a holdout data set. When evaluated with independent, but also sampling-biased test data, correction
            for sampling bias led to improved predictions. The predictive performance of the three modelling algorithms was very similar. Elastic-net models have intermediate performance, with slight advantage for GLMs on cross-validation and Maxent on
            hold-out evaluation. Model-based bias correction is very useful in data-sparse situations, where detailed data are not available to apply other bias correction methods. However, bias correction success depends on how well the selected bias
            variables describe the sources of bias. In this study, accessibility covariates described bias in our data better than effort covariates, and their use led to larger changes in predictive performance. Objectively evaluating bias correction
            requires bias-free presence-absence test data, and without them the real improvement for describing a species' environmental niche cannot be assessed.<br><br><br>

        H hinge; P product; and T threshold. For more details see Elith et al. 2011. b RM is a global multiplier to all individual regularization values; for more details see the main text and Muscarella et al. (2014). Table A2: Estimated best values

        bias inherited in the GBIF database, disallowing the direct use of these records to run SDMs, unless action is taken to correct for sampling bias. GBIF-records are biased mainly towards Western Europe, with sparse locations across Africa, Asia,
        and Eastern Europe. Areas shown in white represent pixels without any records (the majority of North and central Africa, Arabia, and eastern Europe). Clearly errorneous records were excluded before plotting this map.Fig. A2: Left: Map of all GBIF
        bat records (accessed date: April 2015) per a grid of 20 × 20 km2.Right: All records available of the study species, collected either from the literature (blue points) or GBIF (red points). Both maps show large collection gaps. Fig. A3: Per-species
        study area: An example of how the ‘per-species’ study area was determined (here for Asellia tridens). The dashed red line indicates the species extent of occurrence (minimum convex polygon); the solid red line shows the buffer used (1000 km),
        and the dashed green line indicates the study area used. Fig. A4: Variables selection: Pearson correlation coefficient between each pair of the final covariates; see Appendix 3 for more information. Fig A5: Per-species number of backgrounds: Objectively
        determining the adequate number of background ‘quadrature’ points to be used in GLM and elastic-net models (see main text and Renner et al., 2015). DWPR-GLM models (for each species, here: Asellia tridens) were repeated 25 times (each time, with
        a different random sample from the background) with progressively increase the number of background points (from 5000 to 500,000); and for each model, the log-likelihood value is calculated and plotted. The number of backgrounds at which the likelihood
        converges (i.e. no much benefit of using a higher number of backgrounds) is, visually, selected to run the final models. Here, no much improvement in the log-likelihood beyond 300,000 background points (out of 557,800 total available background
        points) and so we used it for this species. Fig. A6: Determining the best value to run the elastic-net model for Nycticeinops schlieffeni (effort model). Eleven values ranging from zero (ridge) to one (lasso), with an increment of 0.1, were used
        to run 11 models on cross-validation. For each value of , glmnet ran many models on a range of -values (estimated from the data; x-axis) and measure the mean cross-validation error (cvm) (here: Poisson deviance; y-axis). The value with the lowest
        cvm is used further while predicting (vertical dotted lines, with colours correspond to the value used). Here, an value of 0.6 is shown to have the lowest cvm and so used further. For more details, see Table A2 and the main text. Fig. A7: Kendall’s
        correlation between (per-species and modelling algorithm) mean AUC evaluated on spatial-block cross-validation and independent evaluation in Egypt. Each point represents the mean of 100 AUC values, with different symbols for each species. Colours
        represent different modelling algorithm used. ‘M’ indicates the overall mean for each modelling algorithm. Panel (a) shows the correlation for the environment-only models (no bias correction). Panels (b-c) represent the accessibility model, without
        and with correcting for sampling bias, respectively. Panels (d-e) represent the effort model, without and with correcting for sampling bias, respectively. Kendall’s correlation coefficients (and their p-values) are reported in each block. Grey
        solid line represents the equality line. AUC performed on cross-validation were, on average, higher than AUC in Egypt. However, there is moderate correlation between bias-free evaluations on either scale. Fig. A8: Equivalent results to Fig. A7,
        for TSS evaluation. Fig A9: Boxplots of the raw cross-validation evaluation (100 values) without (modelling evaluation; a and c) and with (bias-free evaluation; b and d) correction for sampling bias; either using AUC (a - b) or TSS (c - d); see
        Appendix 6 for more information. Horizontal panels show results for different modelling algorithm, while the vertical panels show different bias models. Panels a & c show results for the environment-only model (without any bias manipulation) and
        bias-accounting models (accessibility and effort models) without correcting for sampling bias. However, panels b & d compare results for the environment-only model and bias-accounting models (accessibility and effort models) after correcting for
        sampling bias (see main text; for effort models, plots show evaluations either conditioning the predictions on a value of zero or the maximum relative sampling effort of training presences). Species are in ascending order according to their number
        of occupied pixels at cross-validation scale (with numbers represent the species; see Table 1 for full species names). Fig. A10: Similar to Fig. A9, but showing results of independent evaluation in Egypt. Evaluation metrics are calculated in Egypt
        using mean predictions (of 5-folds cross-validation) in Egypt along with entirely independent species records from Egypt (not used to run any of the models). Species are in ascending order according to their number of occupied pixels in Egypt
        (with numbers represent the species; see Table 1 for full species names). Fig. A11: Species mean TSS calculated either on cross-validation (a - b) or in Egypt (c - d), either without (modelling evaluation; a & c) or with (bias-free evaluation;
        b & d) sampling bias correction (for details, see Appendix 6). Each species is represented by different symbols (similar to those shown in Fig. A7; numbers represent species used, see Table 1). Red lines indicate the overall mean TSS at each modelling
        algorithm and bias models applied. Fig. A12: Kendall’s correlation of the per-species mean TSS between different pairs of modelling algorithms (same as Fig. 2 in the main text, but for TSS). Each species is represented by different symbol (similar
        to those of Fig. A7) with different colours for different bias models applied (using predictions of environment-only model and bias-free prediction of accessibility and effort model). ‘M’ indicates the overall mean evaluation. First row represents
        mean spatial-block cross-validation evaluation, while the second is for independent evaluations in Egypt. Fig. A13: Values of bias variables at presences and available locations (backgrounds), at the per-species study area (A) or at local scale
        ‘Egypt’ (B). Rows correspond to different species, with numbers indicates the species (see Table 1), and columns represent bias variables of the accessibility model (distances to roads, cities, and protected areas) and effort model (relative bats’
        sampling intensity). For each species, values at presence locations are indicated with black, and values at pixels unoccupied by the species are shown in grey. Most of the species are recorded from closer to roads and cities (and to some extent,
        the protected areas), and unexpectedly at low to moderate sampling efforts. Fig. A14: AUC scores calculated the default way (using all available testing backgrounds – y-axis) versus using a fixed ratio between testing presences and backgrounds
        (test-data prevalence = 1:20 – x-axis). (A) shows the raw outputs of 5-folds cross-validation. (B) shows the per-species mean AUC on cross-validation. Different colours represent the three bias models applied (environment-only, accessibility,
        and efforts). Fig. A15: The predicted distribution of Otonycteris hemprichii (mean of 5-folds cross-validation), using different modelling algorithms (rows) and bias models (columns). Maps were scaled between zero and one, as different modelling
        algorithms do not have the same scale, with blue colour indicates higher predicted relative intensity. (A) shows cropped predicted distribution of Otonycteris hemprichii (the same as Fig. 5) to Egypt. Grey points (in the top left panel) represents
        available records used for indepenent evaluation presences in Egypt. In Fig. 5 of the main text, extreme values (> 0.9995 quantile of predicted values) were replaced with their next smaller value to improve map visualization, as GLM and elastic-net
        models sometimes yielded extreme values. Maps in (B) are equivalent to maps in Fig. 5, without any extreme values manipulation (using the linear scale), demonstrating the difficulty of visualizing the predicted patterns in the existence of extreme
        values; see main text for more details. Fig. A16: The reported and predicted distribution of Rhinolophus mehelyi (Maxent). The 2nd to the 4th panels show predictions from environment-only model and bias-free prediction of accessibility and effort
        models, respectively. Arrows represent regions which gain higher predicted values after correcting for sampling bias (such as central Turkey or the Algerian Atlas). Predictions at these areas are of higher uncertainty (lower congurrence) and field
        validation is probably required to confirm the species existence. The lighter the colour, the more suitable the location. Appendix 3: Variables selection List of initial covariates investigated for correlation/multi-collinearity and transformation

        and precipitation recordings from weather stations (Hijmans et al. 2005). Tiles for the overall study area were downloaded at 30 arc-seconds resolution (~1 km near the equator; using the raster R_package), then projected to Mollweide equal-area
        projection at 5 × 5 km2 resolution. The high resolution of 30 arc-seconds was preferred over the 2.5 arc minutes (~5 km near the equator) in order not to lose much information while re-projecting. Instead of interpolation (assigning a value for
        the new pixel equals to the mean of the nearest three points at the original projection), a different approach was employed. First, a template grid covering the study area at the equal-area projection (5 × 5 km2) was prepared. Then, pixels of
        the original variables (at 30 arc-seconds resolution) were converted into centroid points (at the original projection: WGS-1984), then projected into Mollweide projection, then these points were rasterized using the mean value (or other relevant
        function for some variables; e.g. maximum for Bio5) of the points that spatially fall within each cell of the template grid. The same approach was used to prepare all other covariates used in this study. b Global Potential Evapotranspiration (Global-PET)
        & Global Aridity (Zomer et al. 2007, 2008) : available at the global scale at a resolution of 1 km, and were prepared based on models that use data from WorldClim as inputs. Global Actual Evapotranspiration (Global-AET) & Global Soil-Water-Balance
        (Global-SWB) (Trabucco & Zomer 2010) : available at the global scale at a resolution of 1 km, and are prepared based on WorldClim and Global-PET database as primary input. d NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) & EVI (Enhanced Vegetation
        Index) (Didan, 2015) : map tiles for the whole study area were downloaded (and merged) for the period from 18/2/2000 to 22/3/2015 each 16 days (MODIS product: MOD13A2 – resolution: 1 km) using the MODIS R package (Mattiuzzi, 2014). Summary maps
        (maximum, minimum, mean, range, and standard deviation) across the whole period (for NDVI & EVI) were produced at the original MODIS scale/projection using a python code in ‘ArcGIS’ as this was memory intensive to perform in raster package of
        R. Each of the summary layers were then projected into the equal-area projection at 5 × 5 km2 resolution. Possible covariate transformations were investigated, trying to keep some degree of uniform distributions across the range of each covariate
        (following: Dormann 2011). For some covariates, no transformation was effective, and they were kept untransformed. • Variable selection: Multicollinearity amongst the potential covariates )covering the total study area( was assessed, maintaining
        highest GVIF (Generalized Variance Inflation Factor) 3 (Zuur et al. 2009) [which is equivalent, in our case, to maintaining a highest absolute correlation coefficient between each pair of covariates 0.6 and highest VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)
        10]. This was also checked for each species’ study area. Aridity-related covariates (actual/potential evapotranspiration, aridity-index, and soil-water-balance) were all excluded as they show high collinearity with other WorldClim covariates;
        unsurprisingly as they were derived from models that use WorldClim data as input. Out of tensummary vegetation-related covariates, two NDVI covariates were used further: the cumulative minimum and the standard deviation NDVI. They reflect indices
        of minimum biomass and variability of vegetation-cover across the study area, respectively. Appendix 4: Per-species spatial-block cross-validation For each species, a different spatial-block cross-validation structure was used to run SDMs. Pixels
        across the study area were aggregated into larger blocks (each of 20 × 20 cells = 100 × 100 km2), and blocks were distributed into cross-validation folds. Presences and backgrounds in each block were used together either as training or testing
        (Fithian et al. 2015). The blocks were not distributed into cross-validation folds randomly, as this would have yielded highly unbalanced numbers of presence-locations across spatial folds. Instead, we balanced the number of presence locations
        at different folds by calculating their numbers at each block; the top 5 blocks were then, sequentially, randomly assigned to five folds (to avoid that the first fold always has the highest number of presences). To avoid high variability in the
        environmental space between folds and minimise much extrapolation while predicting to the left-out-fold, blocks without any species records were distributed into folds depending on a mean index of their similarity to the overall study area: using
        the Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surfaces ‘MESS’. MESS was proposed by Elith et al. (2010) to identify areas of novel climates by comparing future (or past) climate to those used to run the models, as the interpretation of future projections
        at these locations should be considered with caution. We calculated the MESS-score for each pixel (and a mean value for each block) quite differently from how it was proposed in the first place: we measured the environmental similarity of each
        pixel to all available pixels in the study area (using the ‘dismo’ package). The original application of MESS gives most dissimilar locations more negative values (Elith et al. 2010); however here we expect no negative values as there is no climates
        novelty. Blocks without any presence locations are sorted in descending order (depending on their average MESS value), and then the highest five blocks were distributed randomly into different folds. This was repeated for all blocks until all
        blocks were distributed to different folds. An example of how spatial-block cross-validation applied for Asellia tridens. Different colours represent how different blocks are distributed into cross-validation folds. Blue points represent the species
        known distribution from outside Egypt. For each per species’ study area, a different blocking structure was prepared, to balance the number of presence locations and environmental variability at different cross-validation model runs. Appendix
        5: Sampling-effort model Data for closely related species (bats/non-marine mammals) were downloaded from GBIF (The Global Biodiversity Information Facility – April 2015) and used (along with available focal species records: Tables 1 & A1) to model
        the relative sampling intensity (surveying effort) of bats/mammals. The prediction map of this model was used as bias covariate in the ‘Effort models’ (see main text, Fig. 1, bottom right). Records were assessed before usage (records with missing
        coordinates or with clear errors were excluded: e.g. missed latitude or longitude / equal latitude and longitude / records in the sea or the ocean / potentially swapped latitude and longitude), resulting in a total of 435,458 bat records / 2,039,158
        non-marine mammal records (maps below). GBIF records (for both bats and mammals) show high bias towards the Western Europe compared to any other area in the study area, followed by scattered locations elsewhere (mostly close to the main cities,
        water bodies, populated areas, or seemingly a result of a mammals atlas mapping activity in southwest Africa). The majority of Africa and eastern Europe to western Asia is extremely under-represented in GBIF, with huge gaps in North Africa and
        Arabia. Maps show the number of GBIF records of non-marine mammals (left) and bats (right) per a grid of 20 × 20 km2 (accessed date: April 2015). Initial trials for modelling the sampling effort were done using DWPR-GLM (Down-Weighted Poisson
        Regression) and Maxent (both using PPM-like approach; see main text); without much difference in the resulted prediction pattern (although Maxent model ‘using default feature classes and regularization multiplier’ shows, visually, an over-fitted
        spatial pattern). DWPR-GLM model was chosen to run at 5×5 km2 equal-area projection: all the bats/mammals presence locations as the response (without duplicates removal) and using different covariate set than the environmental variables used to
        run the species SDMs (Merow et al. 2016) Terrain roughness (represented here as a per-pixel standard deviation of altitude): Altitude maps from WorldClim was downloaded at of 30 arc-seconds resolution [~1 km near the equator], then projected as
        points in Mollwide equal-area projection. The points were then converted to a raster (rasterized), representing the standard deviation of the elevation values located at any target pixel at the resolution of 5 × 5 km2; Distance to main cities
        : the Euclidean distance between the centroid of each pixel and the nearest human settlement; Distance to main roads : the Euclidean distance between the centroid of each pixel and the nearest road (Source: Global Roads Open Access Data Set ‘gROADS’);
        Population count : global population count in 2000; Protection status : a binary variable indicating the protection status of each pixel [source: The world Database of Protected Areas:]. The overall pattern of the predicted sampling effort for
        both bats and mammals were roughly similar (maps below), so the prediction from the bats sampling effort model was used further (as bias covariate in the effort model). It represents the overall relative abundance of bat species sightings per
        unit area (based only on non-climatic covariates). The predicted sampling intensity of sightings (sampling effort) for all bats (left) and non-marine mammals (right) using the DWPR-GLM (Down-Weighted Poisson Regression) model. Appendix 6: Mixed

        compared with those of bias accounting models (accessibility and effort), after correction for sampling bias [accessibility bias variables are set to zero, while the effort bias variable is set to either zero or the maximum estimated effort of
        the target species’ presence records; see below]. Species: random factor; categorical variable for the species. Modelling Evaluation – Without Bias correction Variance explained (sum of squares) AUC TSS Mean cross-validation Egypt evaluation Mean

        correcting for sampling bias, initial trials show that using either value for fixing the effort bias covariate produce very similar evaluations (however, Maxent models show quite lower AUCs using the maximum effort value of training presences
        than for fixing at zero; Fig. 3), so we limited further analyses to effortMax.When predicting with fixed values for the bias-covariates, modelling algorithms were most important for explaining variability of cross-validations, followed by sampling-bias
        models and then their interaction (for evaluation in Egypt highest variability was explained by the sampling-bias models, followed by the modelling algorithm, and then their interaction). Again, the number of training presences and study area
        were much less important (and the sign of their effects resembles those of modelling evaluation). The accessibility model had lower AUC compared to the two other sampling-bias models in all comparisons (Fig. 3). On cross-validation, bias-accounting
